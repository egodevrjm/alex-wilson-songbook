## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm 6.x or higher
- A Google Gemini API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Set up your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x setup-api-key.sh
   
   # Run the interactive setup
   ./setup-api-key.sh
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

You can use the provided script to start both the server and client:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start-app.sh

# Run the application
./start-app.sh
```

Alternatively, you can start them separately:

```bash
# Start the server
npm run server

# In a separate terminal, start the client
npm run dev
```

### Testing the Global Function

If you're having issues with the global `createSongFromPrompt` function, you can use the included test page:

1. Start both the server and client
2. Open the client in your browser
3. In a separate tab, open `test-global-function.html`
4. Use the form to test the global function

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error "Failed to generate song Thjis is for Create Song globally":

1. Make sure the server is running
2. Verify your Gemini API key is valid and properly set in the `.env` file
3. Check the browser console for more detailed error messages
4. Try using the AI generation through the UI rather than the global function

## Development

### Project Structure

- `/src` - Frontend React code
  - `/components` - React components
  - `/services` - API services
  - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
  - `/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/data` - Initial data

### AI Integration

The application integrates with Google's Gemini API for:

- Enhancing existing lyrics
- Creating song notes and analysis
- Generating chord progressions
- **AI image generation** for custom song artwork and album covers (Imagen 3)

See `GEMINI_API_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions and `IMAGEN_USER_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive AI image generation documentation.

### Testing the AI Image Generation

To verify your Imagen integration is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test-imagen
```

This will test your API configuration and generate sample images.
