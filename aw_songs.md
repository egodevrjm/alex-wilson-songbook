## A Song and a Beer

### Lyrics

```
```
Verse 1
Dive bar’s hummin’ a Friday night tune,
Jukebox wailin’ some Haggard, beneath the pale moon.
Bartender slides me a cold one, a nod and a grin,
This small-town heartache’s a familiar old friend.

Pre-Chorus
These hands bear the marks of a life hard-won,
But my heart finds its solace in this simple song.

Chorus
Gimme a song and a beer, let the fiddle weep low,
Sing me a story of the life that I know.
From the coal dust I’m made of, to the dreams I hold dear,
I’m livin’ and breathin’ with a song and a beer.

Verse 2
Saw a woman in shadows, her eyes filled with pain,
Dancin’ with ghosts of a love gone in vain.
I raise my glass to the spirits unseen,
Let the fiddle’s lament cut through the smoky sheen.

Pre-Chorus
These boots have walked miles, on roads rough and long,
But this stage is my sanctuary, where I find my song.

Chorus
Gimme a song and a beer, let the fiddle weep low,
Sing me a story of the life that I know.
From the coal dust I’m made of, to the dreams I hold dear,
I’m livin’ and breathin’ with a song and a beer.

Bridge
Every note is a journey, every sip a release,
Carvin’ out my freedom in this honky-tonk peace.
This ain’t just a bar, it’s a haven, a home,
Where the fiddle sings true and my weary heart roams.

Chorus
Gimme a song and a beer, let the fiddle weep low,
Sing me a story of the life that I know.
From the coal dust I’m made of, to the dreams I hold dear,
I’m livin’ and breathin’ with a song and a beer.

Outro
(Fiddle run: G|-0-2-3-5-3-2-0-|)
Raise a glass to the night, let the worries all cease,
I’ve found all I need in this hard-won peace.
```

```

### Notes

## Analysis of "A Song and a Beer"

**Main Themes and Motifs:**

* **Finding solace in simple pleasures:** The song centers around the narrator finding comfort and escape in music, beer, and the camaraderie of a dive bar.
* **Working-class resilience:**  Imagery like "coal in my blood" and "scars on my hands" suggests a hard-working background, but the narrator embraces this identity and finds strength in it.
* **The power of music:** Music is presented as a cathartic force, easing pain and telling the stories of the narrator's life.


**Lyrical Techniques:**

* **Repetition:** The chorus and pre-chorus reinforce the central theme of finding solace in "a song and a beer."
* **Imagery:** Vivid descriptions like "dive bar's hummin'," "eyes cut like a knife," and "bar's smoky gloom" create a strong sense of place and atmosphere.
* **Metaphor:**  "Every note’s a mile, every sip’s a fight" metaphorically connects the act of playing music and drinking to the narrator's journey and struggles.


**Emotional Journey:**

The song begins with a sense of quiet resignation to heartache, but gradually builds towards a feeling of acceptance and even defiance. The initial melancholy evolves into a celebration of simple joys and the strength found in community and self-expression.  The outro offers a final toast to resilience and contentment.


**Notable Songwriting Techniques:**

* **Structure:** The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-bridge structure, providing a familiar framework for the emotional arc.
* **Fiddle motif:**  The recurring mention of the fiddle and the included fiddle run in the outro solidify the importance of music to the narrator's identity and emotional landscape.
* **Contrast:** Juxtaposing images of hardship ("scars on my hands," "harder life") with expressions of joy ("ain't lost my cheer," "livin' just fine") creates a sense of nuanced emotional complexity.
* **Conversational tone:** The direct address ("Gimme a song and a beer") and simple language create an intimate connection with the listener.

## Be Better for the Next Guy

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**
I’m three whiskeys deep, flingin’ darts at the back wall,
Laughin’ at your name etched on my shot glass.
No more lonely nights curled up by the telephone—
I’ve found new roads past the diner where we fought.

**Chorus**
So here’s to you, sweeter than cherry pie—
Hope he buys those roses you let wither and die.
When he’s pourin’ out his heart baby-blue, don’t make him cry—
Be better for the next guy.

**Verse 2**
I’ll catch her eye across the bar when the jukebox spins our song,
She’ll think you’re heaven ’til your lies come undone.
I’ll lift her up with shots of bourbon ’til she’s singin’ along,
While you learn too late how to love someone.

**Chorus (variation)**
So here’s to you, spicier than a jalapeño—
Hope he feels the jagged scars you left on my chest.
When he’s pouring out his soul, don’t put it to the test—
Be better for the next guy.

**Verse 3**
Saw you last weekend at the state fair midway,
Your eyes lit up just like they did back then.
He wore that nervous grin I know all too well—
You led him ’round like he was your only friend.
One prayer for that poor boy’s all I’ve got to give—
May you hold his hand tighter than you ever held mine.

**Bridge**
And if he wakes up cold in your empty bed,
Or finds your lipstick stains on someone else instead,
Tell him to head back to this Tennessee roadhouse—
Where broken hearts learn how to lose and forget.

**Final Chorus**
So here’s to you, sweeter than a Georgia peach—
Don’t leave him sobbin’ under that big open sky.
When he’s layin’ down his love, make sure you don’t lie—
Be better for the next guy.

```

### Notes

## Analysis of "Be Better for the Next Guy"

**Main Themes & Motifs:**

* **Moving On/Finding Peace:** The singer has clearly moved past the pain of the relationship, even finding humor in its remnants (dartboard, shot glass).
* **Karma/Hope for Growth:**  A bittersweet wish for the ex to treat their new partner better, hinting at past mistreatment.
* **Empathy/Shared Experience:** While finding closure, the singer acknowledges the new partner's potential suffering, suggesting a shared experience of heartbreak.
* **Drinking/Roadhouse Setting:**  Alcohol and the roadhouse symbolize escape, camaraderie, and the process of healing and forgetting.


**Lyrical Techniques:**

* **Direct Address:** The repeated "Be better for the next guy" creates a conversational tone, almost a sarcastic toast.
* **Imagery/Sensory Detail:** Vivid descriptions (cherry pie, jalapeño, Georgia peach, lipstick stains) evoke specific emotions and memories.
* **Contrast/Juxtaposition:** The singer's current peace contrasts with the ex's potential to repeat past mistakes.  The lighthearted tone contrasts with the underlying pain.


**Emotional Journey:**

The song progresses from initial flippancy and sarcasm (Verse 1) to a deeper reflection on the past hurt (Verse 2).  Verse 3 introduces a touch of empathy for the new partner, culminating in a genuine, albeit tinged with irony, wish for their well-being in the final chorus and bridge.  The bridge acts as a turning point, offering solace and community to anyone hurt by the ex's actions.

**Notable Songwriting Techniques:**

* **Chorus Variations:**  The changing comparisons in the chorus (cherry pie, jalapeño, Georgia peach) maintain interest while reinforcing the central message.
* **Narrative Storytelling:** The verses paint a clear picture of the past relationship and the singer's present state.
* **Use of Setting:** The roadhouse setting acts as both a literal and symbolic space for healing and shared experience.
* **Irony:** The "toast" format of the chorus is ironic, masking a deeper message of hurt and hope for change.

## Blackberry Creek Rivival

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
No shoes on our feet, but we danced in the mud,  
Sang hymns to the stars with our hearts full of blood.  
In barns by the creek, where the hard times collide,  
We found our salvation where the hopeless reside.  


Pre-Chorus
No money, no mercy, just dreams in our veins,  
We laughed through the hunger, we sang through the chains.  


Chorus
We prayed in barns, we danced in rain,  
Sang away hunger, laughed through pain.  
No silver spoons, just dirt and dreams —  
Our Blackberry Creek revival streams.  


Verse 2
Old men strummed banjos, kids clapped to the beat,  
Mamas wove stories where the broken hearts meet.  
The creek kept on flowin’, like our will to survive,  
Turned coal dust to diamonds in the firelight’s drive.  


Pre-Chorus
No preacher, no riches, just souls intertwined,  
We built our own heaven where the lost could still shine.  


Chorus
We prayed in barns, we danced in rain,  
Sang away hunger, laughed through pain.  
No silver spoons, just dirt and dreams —  
Our Blackberry Creek revival streams.  


Bridge
Every note was a fight, every song was a vow,  
We rose from the ashes, we’re standin’ up now.  
The creek’s still our witness, its waters still sing,  
Our revival’s the pulse of the hope we bring.  


Chorus
We prayed in barns, we danced in rain,  
Sang away hunger, laughed through pain.  
No silver spoons, just dirt and dreams —  
Our Blackberry Creek revival streams.  


Outro
*(Upbeat picking: E|-3-3-3-3-| A|-1-1-5-5-|)*  
Blackberry Creek… where my soul still sings.
```

## Born in Hell

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Coal dust in my lungs, blood on the floor,  
Dad’s fists kept time with the slam of the door.  
Born in a town where the devil holds sway,  
I learned to take hits ‘fore I learned how to pray.  


Pre-Chorus
No mercy in his eyes, no warmth in that house,  
Just a boy dodgin’ shadows, quiet as a mouse.  


Chorus
Born in hell, where the sun don’t shine,  
Took my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.  
Kicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,  
In the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.  


Verse 2
School by day, mines by night, no time to dream,  
Rented a room with walls thin as a scream.  
Sweat and black soot, my hands turned to stone,  
Carried my books and my scars all alone.  


Pre-Chorus
No mother to hold me, no father to care,  
Just the weight of the world and the cold mountain air.  


Chorus
Born in hell, where the sun don’t shine,  
Took my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.  
Kicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,  
In the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.  


Bridge
Every bruise was a map of the hell I called home,  
Every shift in the dark taught me how to roam.  
I wasn’t born to break, though they tried to bend,  
Found a spark in my heart that no devil could end.  


Chorus
Born in hell, where the sun don’t shine,  
Took my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.  
Kicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,  
In the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Born in hell… but I’m still breathin’
```

### Notes

Bio:
 “‘Born in Hell’ lays bare Alex’s brutal beginnings in the mines. It’s a visceral opener that sets the album’s stakes with unflinching honesty.”
What it sounds like:
 Gruff acoustic-guitar strum with a pounding fast-tempo rhythm, fiddle echoing like mournful bells but with unimaginably complex picking 
Pre-Chorus Verse:
 “Coal-dust dreams cling to every breath I draw,
Brutal dawns shaped me long before I saw,
Hope flickered faint where his fists once tore.”
Chorus:
 “Born in hell, where the sun don’t shine,
Took my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.
Kicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,
In the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.”
Post-Chorus Verse:
 “Echoes of the shaft still thrum beneath my skin,
Each scar a medal for the wars I’ve been in,
I stand unbroken though the night feels thin.”
Caption:
 “‘Born in Hell’ is my raw origin story, every verse forged in fire and coal.”
Video:
 Alex stands shirt-on beside his weathered Ford pickup at dawn on a deserted gravel highway. His phone is mounted on the dashboard, framing him and the rolling hills behind as he performs verse, chorus and bridge. At the final chord, he slams the tailgate, sending dust swirling across the roadway.

## Embers to Inferno

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1


Under starlit skies, your shadow’s callin’ me near,


Soft brush of your hand, sendin’ shivers crystal clear.


That quiet little smirk, like a secret you won’t tell,


Got my heart racin’ slow, like a spark in a spell.


Pre-Chorus


Your eyes hold a promise, a flicker in the dark,


Buildin’ up this tension, gonna ignite with a spark.


Chorus


Embers in your eyes, girl, you’re a slow-burnin’ flame,


Teasin’ with a whisper, but you’re stokin’ this game.


Every glance, every sigh, stirrin’ heat in my veins,


The way you’re lookin’ at me, darlin’, it’s a fire that remains.


Verse 2


Your breath’s on my neck, warm and soft like a breeze,


Fingers trace my skin, got me weak in the knees.


We’re swayin’ in the quiet, just the crickets and the night,


But this slow dance is shiftin’, and it’s settin’ us alight.


Pre-Chorus


Your eyes turn to hunger, no more holdin’ it back,


That flicker’s now a wildfire, and I’m under attack.


Chorus


Embers in your eyes, girl, you’re a slow-burnin’ flame,


Teasin’ with a whisper, but you’re stokin’ this game.


Every glance, every sigh, stirrin’ heat in my veins,


The way you’re lookin’ at me, darlin’, it’s a fire that remains.


Bridge


Then it breaks like a storm, and we’re crashin’ in the heat,


Your nails claw my shoulders, bodies movin’ to the beat.


Hips grind like a rhythm that’s too wild to contain,


Moans echo in the darkness, like a sweet, sinful refrain.


We’re past the point of savin’, lost in sweat and desire,


This slow burn’s an inferno, and we’re fuelin’ the fire.


Chorus


Inferno in your eyes, girl, you’re a reckless, ragin’ blaze,


Tearin’ through my senses, got me lost in a daze.


Every thrust, every cry, we’re consumin’ the night,


The way you’re lovin’ me, darlin’, it’s a sin burnin’ bright.


Outro


So keep pullin’ me deeper, let the flames take their toll,


From embers to an inferno, you’re devourin’ my soul.


Inferno in your eyes—girl, it’s where I wanna be,


The way you’re lovin’ me, it’s a fire settin’ me free.
```

(A slow-burn-to-scorching country sex anthem, CMA-adjacent but boldly intense)

## Feels Like Home

### Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Faded blue denim, patched at the knee
Carried me through hell, set my spirit free
Coal dust stains from the seams I crawled
Wore ‘em when the world felt too damn small


[Pre-Chorus]
Through the fields at dawn, ‘neath the red dirt’s glow
Every tear and fray tells the life I know
They held me tight when my heart was torn
Wrapped my bones where my truth was born


[Chorus]
These old blue jeans feel like home
Carved my story in thread and stone
From the mines to the roads where I learned to roam
These old blue jeans feel like home


[Verse 2]
Sweat-soaked days in the summer’s blaze
Danced in ‘em drunk in a starlit haze
They caught my blood when her lies cut deep
Held my pride when I couldn’t sleep


[Pre-Chorus]
Through the fields at dawn, ‘neath the red dirt’s glow
Every tear and fray tells the life I know
They held me tight when my heart was torn
Wrapped my bones where my truth was born


[Chorus]
These old blue jeans feel like home
Carved my story in thread and stone
From the mines to the roads where I learned to roam
These old blue jeans feel like home


[Bridge]
No mansion’s walls, no city’s shine
Could fit my soul like this denim of mine
From the hollers’ cry to the songs I sing
They’re the roots of every damn thing


[Chorus]
These old blue jeans feel like home
Carved my story in thread and stone
From the mines to the roads where I learned to roam
These old blue jeans feel like home


[Outro]
Fiddle hums low, as the night winds moan
These old blue jeans feel like home

```

### Notes

## Performance Notes: Feels Like Home

**Vocal Delivery & Style:**

* **Overall:**  Grounded, authentic, and slightly gritty. Think folk/Americana with a touch of blues. Avoid excessive vibrato; focus on clear storytelling.
* **Verses:** Conversational, reflective. A slight rasp can add to the weathered feel.
* **Pre-Chorus:** Build intensity gradually, adding warmth and emotional depth.
* **Chorus:**  Anthemic but still intimate.  Let the voice soar slightly, conveying a sense of release and belonging.
* **Bridge:** Raw and powerful.  Allow vulnerability to shine through.
* **Outro:** Soft, fading, almost whispered. A sense of peaceful acceptance.

**Emotional Interpretation:**

* This song is about finding comfort and identity in simplicity.  Connect with the feeling of nostalgia, resilience, and the power of personal history.
* The jeans are a metaphor for life experience.  Convey the weight of those experiences – the hardships, the joys, the lessons learned.
* Embrace the vulnerability inherent in the lyrics. Don't be afraid to show the cracks and the strength that comes from them.

**Key Moments to Emphasize:**

* **"Set my spirit free"**: A moment of defiance and liberation.
* **"Every tear and fray tells the life I know"**:  Emphasize the connection between physical wear and emotional journey.
* **"Carved my story in thread and stone"**:  A powerful image.  Deliver with conviction.
* **"No mansion's walls, no city's shine / Could fit my soul like this denim of mine"**:  The core message of the song.  Deliver with passion and conviction.
* **"They're the roots of every damn thing"**:  A statement of identity.  Let it resonate.

**Performance Tips for Connecting with the Audience:**

* **Visuals:**  Consider incorporating simple visuals, like projections of old photographs or weathered denim.
* **Storytelling:** Before singing, share a brief anecdote about a personal object that holds similar significance.
* **Eye contact:**  Connect with individuals in the audience.  Share the story with them directly.
* **Body language:**  Use natural, grounded movements.  Avoid excessive theatrics.  Let the song's emotional core drive your physical expression.
* **Vocal dynamics:** Use light and shade in your voice to create intimacy and build to powerful moments.  The quiet moments can be just as impactful as the loud ones.

## Found Salvation in a Dumpster Guitar

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Back alley shadows, where the drunks lose their way,  
Found a splintered old box in the trash’s decay.  
Six rusted strings, neck warped like my dreams,  
But it hummed like a savior in the moonlight’s beams.  


Pre-Chorus
No angels in this town, just coal and despair,  
But that guitar called my name through the cold, bitter air.  


Chorus
Heard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,  
A broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.  
This dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,  
Found the song that saved my life right there inside of you.  


Verse 2
Dad’s fists were thunder, his bottle was king,  
But I strummed my first chord, felt my heart start to sing.  
Hid it in the shed where his eyes wouldn’t roam,  
Each note was a fire that was callin’ me home.  


Pre-Chorus
No preacher could reach me, no sermon could mend,  
But that guitar was my truth, my beginning, my friend.  


Chorus
Heard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,  
A broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.  
This dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,  
Found the song that saved my life right there inside of you.  


Bridge
Every scratch was a story, every crack was a fight,  
I coaxed out my soul in the dead of the night.  
From a boy lost in silence to a man with a voice,  
This guitar was my freedom, my heart’s only choice.  


Chorus
Heard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,  
A broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.  
This dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,  
Found the song that saved my life right there inside of you.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Dumpster guitar… still singin’ me through.

## Georgia Makes the Devil Her Toy

### Lyrics

```
The Devil crept back to Georgia,  
His heart a smoldering wreck.  
Twice she’d won, left him undone,  
But he craved her spellbound neck.  
He found her lounging by a moonlit spring,  
Her skin aglow with wicked delight.  
“Georgia, you’ve won, but I ain’t done—  
Let’s tangle one last night.”  


She arched a brow, her lips a curve,  
“Devil, you’re bold to try.  
You’ve lost my game, but I’ll stake a claim,  
This time, you’re *mine* to fry.”  
She rose like smoke, her voice a hook,  
And pinned him with a stare.  
“Step to my tune, under this moon,  
Or crawl back to your lair.”  


**Chorus:**  
Embers in the night, her will’s the chain,  
Georgia’s got the Devil on a short rein.  
Silk and steel, she’s calling the play,  
The Devil’s just a toy in her sway.  


Georgia moved like a voodoo queen,  
Her touch a brand on his soul.  
Each sultry glance spun a tighter dance,  
And she took complete control.  
His pride dissolved in her honeyed grip,  
His pleas a whispered song.  
She wove her charm, disarmed his harm,  
And owned him all night long.  


When the sun spilled gold through the willow’s veil,  
The Devil was hers to keep.  
Bound by her spell, he couldn’t rebel,  
His heart in her hands ran deep.  
“Darlin’, you’re mine,” she purred with a grin,  
“My toy ‘til I say when.”  
She snapped her fingers, and off he slunk,  
To serve her again and again.  


**Chorus:**  
Embers in the night, her will’s the chain,  
Georgia’s got the Devil on a short rein.  
Silk and steel, she’s calling the play,  
The Devil’s just a toy in her sway.  


**Outro:**  
The Devil came down to Georgia,  
But Georgia claimed the prize.  
She turned that silver-tongued sinner  
Into a spark in her eyes.

## Get it On

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1  
Your boots hit the hardwood, that grin’s pure sin,  
Leather hugs your curves, pullin’ trouble right in.  
Jukebox kicks low, our shadows start to sway,  
You drag me to the floor, and the night’s set ablaze.  


Chorus  
Get it on, darlin’, let’s two-step this fire,  
Quick-quick, slow-slow, feedin’ my desire.  
Hips move like whiskey, burnin’ through my mind,  
Spin me all night, girl, let’s cross every line.  


Verse 2  
Your breath’s a warm dare, brushin’ close to my skin,  
Crowd’s watchin’ us dance, but we’re lost in the spin.  
Each turn’s a temptation, each step’s a sweet fall,  
Your eyes lock on mine, and I’m riskin’ it all.  


Chorus  
Get it on, darlin’, let’s two-step this fire,  
Quick-quick, slow-slow, feedin’ my desire.  
Hips move like whiskey, burnin’ through my mind,  
Spin me all night, girl, let’s cross every line.  


Bridge  
No preacher can stop us, no saint’s gonna try,  
We’re burnin’ this floor ‘neath a neon-lit sky.  
Dip me down low, let the heat hit its peak,  
This two-step’s our gospel, our salvation to seek.  


Verse 3  
Neon’s a fever, your touch is a spark,  
Every quick step’s ignitin’ the dark.  
You whisper, “Keep movin’,” with a devilish grin,  
This dance is our rebel, our beautiful sin.  


Chorus  
Get it on, darlin’, let’s two-step this fire,  
Quick-quick, slow-slow, feedin’ my desire.  
Hips move like whiskey, burnin’ through my mind,  
Spin me all night, girl, let’s cross every line.  


Outro  
Last note’s fadin’, crowd’s thinnin’ out slow,  
Your lips graze my ear, sayin’, “Don’t let me go.”  
From the quick to the slow, it’s a hell of a ride,  
Get it on, darlin’, you’re my wildest high.

## Guilt and Grief

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Never heard your voice, never felt your touch,  
Just a gravestone whisper in a mining town clutch.  
They say I stole your breath when I took my first,  
Now I carry that weight like a lifelong curse.  


Pre-Chorus
I’d trade all my tomorrows for one yesterday,  
To know the love you never got to say.  


Chorus
I dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —  
A cradle of silence, a story untold.  
I carry your voice in the spaces he left —  
Guilt and grief are all I have left.  


Verse 2
Dad’s eyes were daggers, blamin’ me for your end,  
But I’d see you in dreams where my heart could mend.  
Your shadow’s my shelter when the nights get mean,  
I’m holdin’ onto love I’ve only ever seen.  


Pre-Chorus
I’d give all my songs for one moment with you,  
To feel what a mother’s arms can do.  


Chorus
I dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —  
A cradle of silence, a story untold.  
I carry your voice in the spaces he left —  
Guilt and grief are all I have left.  


Bridge
Every chord I play is a prayer to your name,  
Every tear I hide is a candle’s flame.  
You’re gone, but you’re woven in my every breath,  
I’m livin’ through the guilt to honor your death.  


Chorus
I dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —  
A cradle of silence, a story untold.  
I carry your voice in the spaces he left —  
Guilt and grief are all I have left.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Guilt and grief… my heart’s only theft.

## Here’s to the Ghosts I leave behind

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
I’ve walked through the ashes of a life torn apart,  
Carried the weight of a coal-black heart.  
Some ghosts held me close, some cut like a blade,  
But each one’s a shadow that my soul’s outstayed.  


Pre-Chorus
The road taught me mercy, the pain taught me grace,  
Each step’s a new story writ on my face.  


Chorus
We raise our glasses to the ones who stayed —  
And tip our hats to the ones we outgrew with age.  
There’s grace in the leavin’, mercy in the signs —  
Here’s to the ghosts we leave behind.  


Verse 2
Mom’s in the stars, Dad’s in the dust,  
One gave me love, one broke my trust.  
But I’m more than their echoes, more than their chains,  
I’m the man I built through the joys and the pains.  


Pre-Chorus
The past ain’t my prison, it’s just where I’ve been,  
Each goodbye’s a door to begin again.  


Chorus
We raise our glasses to the ones who stayed —  
And tip our hats to the ones we outgrew with age.  
There’s grace in the leavin’, mercy in the signs —  
Here’s to the ghosts we leave behind.  


Bridge
To the boy I was, scared and alone,  
To the man I am, who found a home.  
Every ghost’s a lesson, every scar’s a line,  
I’m singin’ my freedom, leavin’ ghosts behind.  


Chorus
We raise our glasses to the ones who stayed —  
And tip our hats to the ones we outgrew with age.  
There’s grace in the leavin’, mercy in the signs —  
Here’s to the ghosts we leave behind.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Here’s to the ghosts… I’m leavin’ behind.

<a id="i-raised-myself"></a>

## I raised myself

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Coal dust on my boots, blood on my hands,  
Grew up in a hell where no one understands.  
Dad’s fist was his gospel, his bottle his creed,  
I learned to stand tall while my heart learned to bleed.  


Pre-Chorus
No soft words, no shelter from the storm,  
Just a boy and a guitar keepin’ my soul warm.  


Chorus
No lullabies, no ‘good job, son’ —  
Just the sound of doors slammin’ when the hard times come.  
Scraped my knees and stitched my pride —  
I raised myself, and I survived.  


Verse 2
Kentucky nights taught me how to fight,  
Dodgin’ his shadow in the dim porch light.  
Strummed my pain on strings rusted and worn,  
Turned my scars into songs before the dawn was born.  


Pre-Chorus
No roadmap, no hand to hold me tight,  
Just a fire in my chest burnin’ through the night.  


Chorus
No lullabies, no ‘good job, son’ —  
Just the sound of doors slammin’ when the hard times come.  
Scraped my knees and stitched my pride —  
I raised myself, and I survived.  


Bridge
Every bruise was a lesson, every tear was a flame,  
Built a man from the wreckage of a cursed last name.  
This guitar’s my salvation, my truth, my fight,  
I raised myself to sing into the night.  


Chorus
No lullabies, no ‘good job, son’ —  
Just the sound of doors slammin’ when the hard times come.  
Scraped my knees and stitched my pride —  
I raised myself, and I survived.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
I raised myself… and I’m still alive.

## It Took Losing You to Find Me

### Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Empty echoes in this dawn's soft light
Shadows stretch where your promises died at night
Used to chase your whispers on the breeze
Now I'm chasing something only I can seize


[Pre-Chorus]
Fields once sown with our shared lies
Now bloom with truths I can’t deny
Your absence taught me how to fly


[Chorus]
I buried your lies in the fields of my youth
Laid down the blame and picked up the truth
You broke me to set me free
It took losin’ you to find me


[Verse 2]
Miles of highway, miles inside my soul
Used to follow you, now I’m taking control
Broken pieces scattered on the ground
Built myself up stronger, no lookin’ back around


[Pre-Chorus]
Fields once sown with our shared lies
Now bloom with truths I can’t deny
Your absence taught me how to fly


[Chorus]
I buried your lies in the fields of my youth
Laid down the blame and picked up the truth
You broke me to set me free
It took losin’ you to find me


[Bridge]
Maybe I needed to lose it all
To rise from the ashes, stand up tall
Every tear I shed, a cleansing rain
Washing away the hurt, erasing the pain


[Post-Chorus]
Every wound became the road I walked
I sowed redemption in every talk
Rising stronger than the past I fought


[Chorus]
I buried your lies in the fields of my youth
Laid down the blame and picked up the truth
You broke me to set me free
It took losin’ you to find me


[Outro]
Morning fog lifts, a new day starts to gleam
Yeah, it took losin’ you to wake up from the dream
Find me, find me, find me... now I’m free.

## Kentucky Steel

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**
Born in the shadow of a coal-black vein,
Where the hollers weep and the skies bleed rain.
Dad’s fists were iron, his heart cold stone,
But I carved my soul from the roots I’ve known.

**Pre-Chorus**
Raised by dust and gospel’s steady call,
Forged in shafts where shadows crawl,
My will hammered into iron walls.

**Chorus**
Forged in the hills where the wild winds howl,
Raised by the mines and the gospel sound.
I got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—
This heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.

**Verse 2**
Sweat and grit built these hands of mine,
Crawled through darkness for a dollar’s shine.
Every scar’s a story, every ache a fight,
I’m standin’ tall in the fading light.

**Pre-Chorus**
Raised by dust and gospel’s steady call,
Forged in shafts where shadows crawl,
My will hammered into iron walls.

**Chorus**
Forged in the hills where the wild winds howl,
Raised by the mines and the gospel sound.
I got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—
This heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.

**Bridge**
Fiddle cuts sharp like a miner’s blade,
Each note’s a fire that the pain remade.
I’m forged from the hollers, unyielding and true,
This spirit’s unbreakable, and it’s carryin’ through.

**Chorus**
Forged in the hills where the wild winds howl,
Raised by the mines and the gospel sound.
I got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—
This heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.

**Post-Chorus**
Every strike on steel became my song,
Each scar a verse that made me strong,
I stand unbroken where I belong.

**Outro **
Hollers still echo, but I’m holdin’ the line,
Kentucky steel runs deep in this heart of mine.

## Love Ain’t Enough

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Screen lit up, your face in the glow,  
Laughin’ with shadows I ain’t meant to know.  
Whiskey’s burnin’, but it don’t kill the pain,  
Your voice, their hands, it’s tearin’ up my brain.  


Pre-Chorus
I trusted your lies, fell for every word,  
Now I’m drownin’ in the truth I wish I hadn’t heard.  


Chorus
You gave me forever, but you meant it for a while —  
I gave you my heart, you gave me back a smile.  
Love isn’t enough when the storm clouds come —  
It’s a promise in the sunlight, but it’s gone by the dawn.  


Verse 2
I blocked your ass faster than a bullet leaves a gun,  
Erased your sweet nothin’s, left your memory undone.  
But this bottle’s still heavy, and the night’s still long,  
Your betrayal’s a chorus to a lonesome, bitter song.  


Pre-Chorus
I see it all now, the truth in the flame,  
But I’m the damn fool who’s still cursin’ your name.  


Chorus
You gave me forever, but you meant it for a while —  
I gave you my heart, you gave me back a smile.  
Love isn’t enough when the storm clouds come —  
It’s a promise in the sunlight, but it’s gone by the dawn.  


Bridge
Was I just a spark you let burn out and fade?  
A heart you could steal, then toss in the shade?  
This guitar’s my witness, these strings bleed my cry,  
I’m done with your games, but I’m too broke to lie.  


Chorus
You gave me forever, but you meant it for a while —  
I gave you my heart, you gave me back a smile.  
Love isn’t enough when the storm clouds come —  
It’s a promise in the sunlight, but it’s gone by the dawn.  


Outro
Screen’s gone dark, but the hurt’s still alive,  
Love ain’t enough to keep this soul revived.  
*(Slow picking on low E)*  
Gone by the dawn… gone by the dawn.
```

## My Mother’s Eyes

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Never knew your smile, never heard your call,  
Just a faded photo on a cracked bedroom wall.  
But when the mirror catches me in the morning’s glare,  
I see your fire burnin’, and I know you’re there.  


Pre-Chorus
You gave me your spirit when you gave me my life,  
Your love’s in my blood, sharper than a knife.  


Chorus
She never heard my first cry, never wiped my fears,  
But her face stares back in my morning mirror.  
The love I never touched still paints my skies —  
I was born with my mother’s eyes.  


Verse 2
Dad said I killed you, but I feel you near,  
In the songs I sing, in the dreams that appear.  
Your strength’s in my hands when I strum through the pain,  
Your heart’s in my chest when I’m walkin’ through rain.  


Pre-Chorus
You left me your courage when you left this earth,  
I’m livin’ your love in the songs of my birth.  


Chorus
She never heard my first cry, never wiped my fears,  
But her face stares back in my morning mirror.  
The love I never touched still paints my skies —  
I was born with my mother’s eyes.  


Bridge
Every note’s a letter to the mother I’ve known,  
Every chord’s a root in the seeds you’ve sown.  
You’re the light in my darkness, the truth in my cries,  
I’m carryin’ your love in my mother’s eyes.  


Chorus
She never heard my first cry, never wiped my fears,  
But her face stares back in my morning mirror.  
The love I never touched still paints my skies —  
I was born with my mother’s eyes.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
My mother’s eyes… my heart’s only light.

## Running Free

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Highway hums low, just me and the sky,  
That video call’s just a ghost in my mind.  
Left the roadhouse behind, let the whiskey burn clean,  
I’m carryin’ my scars, but my heart’s runnin’ lean.  


Pre-Chorus
No chains, no pain, just the road up ahead,  
I’m livin’ for me, not the tears that I shed.  


Chorus
Runnin’ free, with the fire in my soul,  
No more chasin’ your lies down a dead-end road.  
Built a man from the wreckage you left in your wake,  
This heart’s still alive, and it’s runnin’ free today.  


Verse 2
Pass that old diner where we scratched our dreams,  
Now it’s dust on my boots, just a faded old scene.  
The jukebox don’t haunt me, the nights don’t bite,  
These strings sing my freedom in the pale starlight.  


Pre-Chorus
No ghosts, no grief, just the wind at my back,  
I’m writin’ my story on this endless black track.  


Chorus
Runnin’ free, with the fire in my soul,  
No more chasin’ your lies down a dead-end road.  
Built a man from the wreckage you left in your wake,  
This heart’s still alive, and it’s runnin’ free today.  


Bridge
I forgave the fool I was for lovin’ you blind,  
Found a steel in my bones that your betrayal refined.  
The road ain’t salvation, but it’s honest and wide,  
I’m runnin’ toward freedom with my head held high.  


Chorus
Runnin’ free, with the fire in my soul,  
No more chasin’ your lies down a dead-end road.  
Built a man from the wreckage you left in your wake,  
This heart’s still alive, and it’s runnin’ free today.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Highway keeps callin’, I ain’t lookin’ behind,  
Runnin’ free, with a strong, steady mind.

## Saturday Night Salvation

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**
Gravel lot’s kickin’ up dust in the glow,
Jukebox blarin’ where the wild ones go.
Boots stomp hard to a Haggard tune,
Neon’s hummin’ under a Kentucky moon.

**Pre-Chorus**
Tailgates down beneath neon haze,
Spilt laughter echoin’ neon blaze,
We chased release through Friday’s maze.

**Chorus**
Tailgates down, radios loud,
Freedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.
Raise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,
Find Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.

**Verse 2**
She’s dancin’ close, with a spark in her grin,
Leather and denim, pullin’ me in.
Cold beer sweats in a red solo cup,
We’re livin’ for now, never givin’ up.

**Pre-Chorus**
Tailgates down beneath neon haze,
Spilt laughter echoin’ neon blaze,
We chased release through Friday’s maze.

**Chorus**
Tailgates down, radios loud,
Freedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.
Raise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,
Find Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.

**Bridge**
Fiddle screams high, cuttin’ through the night,
Every chord’s a spark, settin’ hearts alight.
We’re rebels and dreamers, breakin’ every chain,
Baptized in the chaos, washed clean by the flame.

**Chorus**
Tailgates down, radios loud,
Freedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.
Raise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,
Find Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.

**Post-Chorus**
Drunk on music, bruised by dawn’s light,
We stumble home from wild delight,
Hearts baptized in the endless night.

**Outro** (Fiddle run: G|-3-5-7-5-3-0-|)
Stars fade slow, but we’re holdin’ on tight,
Livin’ for the rush of a Saturday night.

```

## Skin On Mine

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1

Worn boots on the porch, dust on the vine,

Your shadow’s my shelter in this heart of mine.

Every wound I carry, you trace with care,

Findin’ redemption in the weight we share.

Pre-Chorus

Your touch maps secrets on my scars,

Soft confession under midnight stars,

I learn salvation in your arms.

Chorus

A whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,

The only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.

No angels needed, no preacher’s sign —

Just your hands reading verses down my broken lines.

Post-Chorus

Heat lingers where your breath once played,

Every ache and longing unafraid,

I find my home in the debt we’ve paid.

Verse 2

Old truck radio hums a lonesome tune,

Moonlight paints us in a silver cocoon.

Your eyes hold forgiveness for the roads I’ve roamed,

In your arms, I’m more than the miles I’ve known.

Pre-Chorus

Your touch maps secrets on my scars,

Soft confession under midnight stars,

I learn salvation in your arms.

Chorus

A whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,

The only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.

No angels needed, no preacher’s sign —

Just your hands reading verses down my broken lines.

Bridge

We’ve burned through sins, we’ve paid the cost,

Found our heaven in the love we’ve lost.

No church could hold what we’ve designed,

Just two souls tangled, your skin on mine.

Chorus

A whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,

The only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.

No angels needed, no preacher’s sign —

Just your hands reading verses down my broken lines.

Outro

Heat lingers where your breath once played,

Every ache and longing unafraid.

Under these stars, we’ll never resign,

I’ll keep on prayin’ with your skin on mine.

## Sometimes Cowboys Stay

### Lyrics

```
(Classic Country Standard)
Verse 1

I’ve roamed the wide plains where the wild winds call,

Chased dreams ‘cross canyons, watched the mighty fall.

But your gentle touch stopped this drifter’s heart,

Showed me a horizon where forever could start.

No lonesome trail could pull me away,

‘Cause darlin’, I learned that sometimes cowboys stay.
Chorus

We don’t ride off into sunsets alone —

Some of us plant our boots and build a home.

With every nail, with every prayer,

We carve a life from the love we share.

Through storms and years, come what may,

I’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.
Verse 2

The old songs sing of the wanderer’s road,

A heart unbound, carryin’ a lonesome load.

But I found my freedom in the vows we made,

In the porch we built and the plans we laid.

Your hand in mine is my promised land,

A stronger call than the open sand.
Chorus

We don’t ride off into sunsets alone —

Some of us plant our boots and build a home.

With every nail, with every prayer,

We carve a life from the love we share.

Through storms and years, come what may,

I’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.
Bridge

Let the world keep spinnin’, let the rivers run,

We’ll raise our babies ‘neath this prairie sun.

No fence can hold us, but we choose to stand,

Rooted together on this sacred land.

Every scar, every laugh, every tear we’ve known,

Proves a cowboy’s heart can call one place home.
Chorus

We don’t ride off into sunsets alone —

Some of us plant our boots and build a home.

With every nail, with every prayer,

We carve a life from the love we share.

Through storms and years, come what may,

I’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.
Verse 3

When the years have silvered your hair and mine,

When the stars look down on this life divine,

I’ll still be here, by your side I’ll stand,

Holdin’ the heart that still holds my hand.

From our first dance to our final day,

I’ll love you, darlin’, ‘cause cowboys stay.
Final Chorus

We don’t ride off into sunsets alone —

Some of us plant our boots and build a home.

With every nail, with every prayer,

We carve a life from the love we share.

Through storms and years, come what may,

I’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.
Outro

Yeah, through storms and years, come what may,

My heart’s right here, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.

## Tailgate Nights

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1  
Pickup’s parked where the river runs slow,  
Stars are burnin’ like a backroad show.  
Cooler’s stocked, and the fire’s alight,  
We’re kickin’ up dust on a tailgate night.  


Pre-Chorus  
No city lights, no weight to bear,  
Just a small-town heart and the open air.  


Chorus  
Tailgate nights, where the fiddle sings free,  
Dancin’ in the moonlight with the whole world and me.  
From the hollers we rise to the dreams we ignite,  
We’re livin’ for love on these tailgate nights.  


Verse 2  
She’s laughin’ loud with a spark in her grin,  
Spinnin’ in boots where the wild grass begins.  
I pull that bow, let the strings tell the tale,  
Of a boy and a girl and a love that won’t fail.  


Pre-Chorus  
No past to haunt, no wrongs to right,  
Just her in my arms on a tailgate night.  


Chorus  
Tailgate nights, where the fiddle sings free,  
Dancin’ in the moonlight with the whole world and me.  
From the hollers we rise to the dreams we ignite,  
We’re livin’ for love on these tailgate nights.  


Bridge  
Every scrape of the bow’s a spark in the dark,  
Every beat of her heart’s a new place to start.  
This riverbank’s ours, where the future feels right,  
We’re writin’ our story on a tailgate night.  


Chorus  
Tailgate nights, where the fiddle sings free,  
Dancin’ in the moonlight with the whole world and me.  
From the hollers we rise to the dreams we ignite,  
We’re livin’ for love on these tailgate nights.  


Outro  
*(Fiddle run: G|-3-5-7-5-3-0-|)*

Forever’s born here on a tailgate night.

## Tailgate Testament

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1 Golden light on a dirt road’s bend, Two kids dreamin’ where the world don’t end. His old Ford hums with a radio glow, Singin’ soft to the love we know.

Pre-Chorus Dust swirled around barefoot vows, Horizon stretched beyond our brows, We carved forever in simple vows.

Chorus A beat-up truck, a sunset drive, A cooler full of promises we’ll barely survive. In these fields, our hearts confess, This is our tailgate testament.

Post-Chorus Sunset fades but our words remain, Etched in gravel and harvested grain, We hold this moment through joy and pain.

Verse 2 Crickets hum as the stars ignite, Her hand in mine feels like every right. We dance in the glow of a tailgate throne, Buildin’ a future from dreams we’ve sown.

Pre-Chorus Dust swirled around barefoot vows, Horizon stretched beyond our brows, We carved forever in simple vows.

Chorus A beat-up truck, a sunset drive, A cooler full of promises we’ll barely survive. In these fields, our hearts confess, This is our tailgate testament.

Bridge No chapel walls, no preacher’s call, Just open skies and the truth of it all. We’ll weather storms, we’ll chase the light, Swearin’ our love in the warm summer night.

Chorus A beat-up truck, a sunset drive, A cooler full of promises we’ll barely survive. In these fields, our hearts confess, This is our tailgate testament.

Outro Boots in the grass, the night rolls in, Our story’s written where the stars begin. Through every mile, we’ll still profess, This is our tailgate testament.

## The Devil Went Down on Georgia

### Lyrics

```
**(inspired by but not the same music as the original )**

**Verse**
The Devil went down on Georgia,
He was lookin' for a soul to tease.
He was feelin' bold, and truth be told,
He was itchin' for a little release.
When he came across this fiery girl,
Dancin' in the midnight air,
The Devil tipped his hat and said,
"Girl, you got that devil-may-care."
"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a pleaser too," he grinned,
"And if you care to take a dare, I'll show you where I've been.
Now you strut so sweet, and you taste so fine,
I'll lay my pride upon the line —
If you let me under that southern sky,
I'll show you a helluva time."
Georgia said, "My daddy warned me 'bout your kind, you rogue,
But I've got a wild side too, so go on, strike your pose!"
She slipped her hands along his jaw,
And whispered low and sly,
"If you're gonna play down in my field,
You better kiss the ground goodbye."

**Chorus**
Fire in the bayou, heat on the breeze,
Moonlight melting down through the trees.
Satin and smoke, and a slow, low moan —
The Devil's got Georgia in a world of her own.
The Devil laid low with a wicked grin,
Took his time with a Southern spin,
Every kiss a little sin,
Georgia just pulled him in.

**Verse**
When the morning broke through pine and oak,
Georgia laughed and twirled,
She'd played that Devil like a fiddle and bow —
And she owned the whole damn world.
He said, "Girl, you are a wildfire —
You burned me to the bone."
She just smiled and tipped her hat,
Said, "That's what you get for comin' down my road."

**(Chorus Repeat)**
Fire in the bayou, heat on the breeze,
Moonlight melting down through the trees.
Satin and smoke, and a slow, low moan —
The Devil's got Georgia in a world of her own.

**(Outro)**
The Devil went down on Georgia,
But Georgia ran the show —
She turned that red-hot sinner
Into a puddle on the floor.

```

### Notes

## The Devil Went Down on Georgia: Backstory

**Inspiration:**  This song isn't about a fiddle contest. It's a metaphorical tale of seduction and empowerment. Inspired by old blues songs about deals with the devil and Southern Gothic literature, the songwriter flipped the script. Instead of the Devil corrupting an innocent soul, a strong, confident woman takes control and leaves the Devil utterly defeated.

**Themes & Emotions:** Female empowerment, sexual liberation, defiance, reclaiming narrative, playful dominance, reversing traditional gender roles. The song explores the thrill of temptation, the power of self-possession, and the satisfaction of outsmarting a formidable opponent.

**Songwriter Connection:** Possibly written by a woman who experienced a moment of profound self-discovery and liberation after escaping a toxic or controlling relationship.  The Devil could represent patriarchal structures, societal expectations, or a specific individual who attempted to diminish her. The act of "playing the Devil" becomes a metaphor for reclaiming her agency and defining her own terms.

**Context:** Imagine a smoky blues club in New Orleans in the late 1960s or early 1970s.  The second-wave feminist movement is gaining momentum, and women are challenging traditional roles.  The songwriter, perhaps a rising star on the blues scene, crafts this song as an anthem of female strength and sexual agency, resonating with a generation eager to break free from societal constraints.  The bayou setting adds a layer of mystique and connects the narrative to a specific Southern landscape rich in folklore and symbolism.

## The Girl In The Summer Dress

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1

She sauntered in the diner, with a devilish sway,

That summer dress clingin’ in a dangerous way.

One wink over coffee, set my pulse to a race,

God makes the good stuff, and she owned that space.
Chorus

One look, one laugh, and the sparks flew free,

A jolt of pure trouble meant just for me.

Her touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,

The girl in the summer dress took full control.
Verse 2

She leaned in real close, stole my shades with a grin,

Her whisper was velvet, brushed like fire on my skin.

She danced with a swagger, left my heart in a bind,

One graze of her fingers, and I lost my damn mind.
Chorus

One look, one laugh, and the sparks flew free,

A jolt of pure trouble meant just for me.

Her touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,

The girl in the summer dress took full control.
Bridge

Now the diner’s too tame, but her heat lingers on,

That mischievous glint in her eyes ain’t gone.

I toast to the thrill, to the game that she played,

One taste of her magic, and my night was made.
Final Chorus

One look, one laugh, and I’m still feelin’ wild,

A flash of her fire keeps this cowboy beguiled.

Her touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,

The girl in the summer dress—God, she was bold.

## The Mourning After

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Woke up to a headache and your face in my mind,  
That video call still burns like cheap red wine.  
I torched your old photos in a rusted tin can,  
But your laugh keeps echoin’ through this broken man.

I’m half-dead, but I’m fightin’ to breathe,  
Tradin’ tears for the strength to believe.

Verse 2
New bar down the highway, new smoke in the air,  
A girl’s crooked smile says she don’t know my care.  
I’m shakin’ off the weight of your cheatin’ disguise,  
But your voice still cuts through the neon-lit skies.  


Pre-Chorus
I’m not healed, but I’m startin’ to mend,  
Carvin’ out a road where your lies gotta end.

The mournin’ after’s a cold, lonesome fight,

Every mile I drive, I bury you deeper in the dust,  
Every shot I take, I’m weldin’ back my trust.  
Your love was a blade that cut me to the core,  
But I’m stitchin’ up my soul, I don’t need you no more.  


Chorus
The mournin’ after’s a cold, lonesome fight,  
Scrapin’ up my heart in the pale morning light.  
I’m chasin’ new shadows where your ghost don’t roam,  
Findin’ my way, but I ain’t yet home.  


Outro
New dives, new dawns, new battles to win,  
The mournin’ after’s where I’m learnin’ to begin.

Mournin’ after you… I’m startin’ again.

## The Music

### Lyrics

```
Words and soul by @blackberrysoul
Verse 1

I was born in a holler where the coal dust sings,

Raised on the ache of broke-down things.

A trailer’s shadow, a father’s fist,

Found my salvation in a six-string’s kiss.

Hid that guitar where the floorboards creak,

Played ‘til my fingers bled, too scared to speak.

Chorus

When the world talks too loud for a man to pray,

I find my gospel in the strings I play.

Notes fall like rain on a dust-dry field—

The music finds the parts I forgot to heal.

It’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,

The music carries me when I’m black and blue.
Verse 2

Found a fiddle in a dumpster, strings half-dead,

Taught it to cry for the dreams in my head.

Piano keys I traced on a tabletop worn,

Built me a hymn where my heart was torn.

Every scar’s a chord, every bruise a rhyme,

Music’s the only thing that’s mine all the time.
Chorus

When the world talks too loud for a man to pray,

I find my gospel in the strings I play.

Notes fall like rain on a dust-dry field—

The music finds the parts I forgot to heal.

It’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,

The music carries me when I’m black and blue.
Bridge

When the bottle’s empty and the night’s too long,

When love turns to lies and the road feels wrong,

I don’t need a preacher, don’t need a sign—

Just a battered Martin and a melody line.

It pulls me through the dark, it speaks my name,

Turns my silence to a holy flame.
Verse 3

Now I’m runnin’ on roads where the maps don’t go,

Chasin’ a sound only my heart knows.

Strangers hear my voice, they feel my pain,

Say it’s like thunder callin’ down the rain.

But it ain’t for them, it’s for the boy I was—

Who found his freedom in a guitar’s buzz.
Final Chorus

When the world talks too loud for a man to pray,

I find my gospel in the strings I play.

Notes fall like rain on a dust-dry field—

The music finds the parts I forgot to heal.

It’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,

The music carries me when I’m black and blue.
Outro

So let the world keep screamin’, let the shadows fall,

The music’s my answer, my only call.

From a trailer’s ruin to a stage unknown,

The music’s the fire that brings me home.

## The Way You Make Me Feel

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1

Your silhouette’s a spark in the twilight’s glow,

Leather and lace, where the wild things grow.

One look from you, and my defenses all reel,

You’re a storm Marie Antoinette, and I’m under your spell.
Chorus

Whiskey on your lips, sunset on your skin —

Every ‘no’ I ever said, you pull it out again.

The way you move, the way you steal —

God help me, girl, the way you make me feel.
Verse 2

Boots on the floor, rhythm slow and unkind,

You’re a temptation that’s burnin’ my mind.

Your touch is a fuse, lightin’ fires I conceal,

This heart’s runnin’ hot, and it’s losin’ the wheel.
Chorus

Whiskey on your lips, sunset on your skin —

Every ‘no’ I ever said, you pull it out again.

The way you move, the way you steal —

God help me, girl, the way you make me feel.
Bridge

No salvation in sight, no way to repent,

You’re a sin I’d commit, every dollar I’ve spent.

Your kiss is a chain, and I’m locked in your thrill,

I’d fall a thousand times just to feel that chill.
Verse 3

Starlight’s fadin’, but your eyes still burn,

Every curve of you makes my whole world turn.

You’re the devil’s own dance, yet you’re all that’s ideal,

I’m a goner, sweet darlin’, the way you make me feel.
Chorus

Whiskey on your lips, sunset on your skin —
Every ‘no’ I ever said, you pull it out again.
The way you move, the way you steal —
God help me, girl, the way you make me feel.
Outro

When the night calls soft, and the shadows get real,

You’re the only truth that my soul wants to feel.

From your wicked sweet smile to the heat you reveal,

I’m yours, my love, the way you make me feel.

## The Weight of Silence

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Words we never spoke cut deeper than his belt,  
Every silent scream was a wound I felt.  
Learned to bite my tongue ‘fore I learned to pray,  
Carried that quiet through each hellbound day.  


Pre-Chorus
Truth was a ghost in that house of pain,  
But silence was the chain I broke to stay sane.  


Chorus
Screamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,  
But I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.  
Every heavy word we never said still shines —  
In the weight of silence left behind.  


Verse 2
Dad’s liquor breath was louder than his care,  
His fists wrote stories in the midnight air.  
I built my strength in the spaces he ignored,  
Turned my mute defiance to a warrior’s sword.  


Pre-Chorus
Pain was a language we both understood,  
But I chose the quiet to carve my own good.  


Chorus
Screamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,  
But I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.  
Every heavy word we never said still shines —  
In the weight of silence left behind.  


Bridge
Now I sing the truths I buried as a boy,  
Each note’s a spark, each chord’s a joy.  
The weight of silence taught me how to stand,  
I’m breakin’ its chains with these calloused hands.  


Chorus
Screamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,  
But I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.  
Every heavy word we never said still shines —  
In the weight of silence left behind.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
The weight of silence… I’m leavin’ it behind.

Verse 1
Your name’s a bruise I wore like a brand,  
Carved in my bones by your heavy hand.  
A house full of echoes, a heart full of rust,  
You left me your anger, but never your trust.  


Pre-Chorus
I walked through your fire, I carried your blame,  
But I’m done bendin’ under your cursed last name.  


Chorus
A hollow house, a heavy name —  
I carry your lessons and your shame.  
But you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —  
I’m not just what Dad left behind.  


Verse 2
Your whiskey-soaked rants were my lullaby,  
Each swing of your fist was a reason to try.  
I built my own road from the wreckage you made,  
Turned your broken legacy to a debt I’ve repaid.  


Pre-Chorus
I fought through your darkness, I found my own light,  
I’m claimin’ my freedom in the dead of the night.  


Chorus
A hollow house, a heavy name —  
I carry your lessons and your shame.  
But you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —  
I’m not just what Dad left behind.  


Bridge
Every scar’s a story, every fight’s a song,  
I’m stronger for the pain you heaped on so long.  
Your ghost don’t own me, I’m cuttin’ the ties,  
I’m risin’ above what Dad left in his lies.  


Chorus
A hollow house, a heavy name —  
I carry your lessons and your shame.  
But you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —  
I’m not just what Dad left behind.  


Outro
*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*  
Not just what Dad left behind… I’m free.
```

## When Mountains Weep

### Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Coal dust settles where the pines grow thin
Hollers whisper of the hurt within
Graves unmarked beneath the ridge’s weight
Hold the dreams that time forgot to save


[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers carve the scars my fathers wore
Silent hollers crying out once more
Stone and sweat forever at war


[Chorus]
The hollers cry where the coal veins died
The rivers mourn where our fathers lied
When blood stains stone and secrets keep
Even the mountains, even they weep


[Verse 2]
Mama’s prayers sank in the valley’s shade
Pappa’s hands broke for the debts unpaid
Their ghosts still walk where the wildflowers fade
In the shadow of the lives they made


[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers carve the scars my fathers wore
Silent hollers crying out once more
Stone and sweat forever at war


[Chorus]
The hollers cry where the coal veins died
The rivers mourn where our fathers lied
When blood stains stone and secrets keep
Even the mountains, even they weep


[Bridge]
Every seam I crawled, I learned their pain
Every callus holds a family’s chain
Betrayed by love, by land, by greed
I sing for souls this world don’t need


[Post-Chorus]
Wind carries tales of loss and shame
Each echo bearing an unspoken name
I sing their sorrow into lasting flame


[Chorus]
The hollers cry where the coal veins died
The rivers mourn where our fathers lied
When blood stains stone and secrets keep
Even the mountains, even they weep


[Outro]
Beneath the peaks where the silence sleeps
Even the mountains, even they weep
```

## Yes, Boys Do Cry Sometimes

### Lyrics

```
﻿Yes, Boys Do Cry Sometimes
(Verse 1) Shoulders built like mountains, jaw carved out of stone Walk this Pikeville dirt path feelin' quite alone Got the kind of blue eyes make the girls all stare Wear these calloused knuckles like a cross I bear Down on Blackberry Creek, in that rusty double-wide Hid that broke-string guitar deep down safe inside Found it by the highway, six years old and scared Played out Daddy's liquor snores, a secret life I shared Heard him slur, "You killed her," felt the belt bite deep and low Learned to choke the music back, not let the feelin' show
(Chorus) They tell you build the walls high, boy, be a man of stone Keep the hurtin' buried, deep inside the bone Straighten up that backbone, don't you show the fear But some floods rise too heavy, year after lonely year Yeah, the dam can break, the ocean starts to rise Yes, boys do cry sometimes, behind these fighter's eyes
(Verse 2) Left home at sixteen, punch fresh on my face Found a room with Jonesy, another sorry place Crawled the seams on bloody knees, breathed the black-lung air Worked the fields till sundown, showin' you I cared Every eighteen-hour day, scrapin' dirt and coal Was sendin' you to college, tryin' to make you whole You were my one soft place, my only whispered dream My anchor 'gainddddst the current of that dark Kentucky stream Then that movin' picture, shinin' on the screen Showed my anchor draggin' through a place I'd never been
(Chorus) They tell you build the walls high, boy, be a man of stone Keep the hurtin' buried, deep inside the bone Straighten up that backbone, don't you show the fear But some floods rise too heavy, year after lonely year Yeah, the dam can break, the ocean starts to rise Yes, boys do cry sometimes, behind these fighter's eyes
(Bridge) This body's built for battle, muscle hard and tight Thought I'd carved out somethin' that could stand against the night But muscle can't stop memories, can't outrun the fear And betrayal's got a sharp edge, cuts you ear to ear This choked-up voice inside me, the songs I couldn't free Screamin' silent thunder, now spillin' out of me It ain't weakness breakin', maybe it's the start Of lettin' out the poet trapped inside this bleedin' heart
(Chorus) They tell you build the walls high, boy, be a man of stone Keep the hurtin' buried, deep inside the bone Straighten up that backbone, don't you show the fear But some floods rise too heavy, year after lonely year Yeah, the dam can break, the ocean starts to rise Yes, boys do cry sometimes, behind these fighter's eyes
(Outro) So I hold this rescued six-string, scarred up just like me Let the teardrops fall like acid rain, finally runnin' free Underneath this coal town moon, lettin' the pain bleed through... Yes, boys do cry sometimes... tonight, this boy does too. (Guitar fades out slowly, leaving a resonant, aching chord)

## Devil Came Back for Georgia 

### Lyrics

```
The Devil Came Back to Georgia  
The Devil came back to Georgia,  
He was burnin’ for a second round.  
That first defeat left his pride in heat,  
And he craved that sultry sound.  
He found her swayin’ by a riverside,  
Under stars that pulsed with sin,  
Her eyes like coals, she stirred his soul,  
And he swore he’d win her grin.  

“Well, darlin’, I’m back,” he purred with a leer,  
“Got a new game to ignite.  
You scorched me once, but I’m no dunce,  
This time I’ll own the night.”  
He flicked his tongue, let the shadows hum,  
And the air grew thick with lust.  
“I’ll raise the stakes, make no mistake,  
This dance’ll turn you to dust.”  

Georgia laughed, her voice like wine,  
“Devil, you’re barkin’ up my tree.  
You think you’re sly, but I’ll make you cry,  
‘Cause this fire belongs to me.”  
She stepped in close, her breath a tease,  
Let her fingers graze his chest.  
“Bring your best, I’ll do the rest,  
And put your wicked heart to rest.”  

**Chorus:**  
Sparks on the river, flames in the dark,  
Georgia’s got that untamed spark.  
Velvet and venom, a dangerous game,  
The Devil’s lost in Georgia’s flame.  

The Devil moved with a serpent’s grace,  
Every touch a fevered spell.  
He wove his charm, thought he’d do no harm,  
But Georgia knew his hell.  
She matched his heat, step for step,  
Her hips a taunting dare,  
Each whispered word made his senses blur,  
Till he was drowning in her stare.  

When the dawn crept soft through the cypress shade,  
The Devil knelt, undone.  
Georgia smirked, her magic worked,  
She’d played him ‘til she’d won.  
“You thought you’d tame me, sweet Lucifer,  
But I’m the queen of this domain.”  
She blew a kiss, left him in bliss,  
And sent him back to his pain.  

**Chorus:**  
Sparks on the river, flames in the dark,  
Georgia’s got that untamed spark.  
Velvet and venom, a dangerous game,  
The Devil’s lost in Georgia’s flame.  

**Outro:**  
The Devil came back to Georgia,  
But Georgia stole the crown.  
She spun that sly ol’ sinner  
And burned his kingdom down.

## Hollow Turns Hallelujah

### Lyrics

```
Hollow Turns Hallelujah

**Verse 1**
Boot prints fading, desert moon hanging low
Guard duty whispers, stories we all know
Chopper blades turning, a melancholic drone
The campfire's out, brothers gone, too soon flown


**Verse 2**
We built our bunkers, sandbags stacked up high
Dreamed of homecomings 'neath a foreign sky
Shared our rations, stories raw and true
Now the echoes fade, a future we couldn't view


**Chorus**
But the hollow turns hallelujah, in the quiet of the years
A symphony of service, washed away by bittersweet tears
We raise our voices, cracked and worn, a campfire choir once more
Singin' hymns of resilience, from the scars that we bore


**Verse 3**
Rifle shots echo, a bugle out of tune
Forgotten faces flicker beneath the desert moon
The camaraderie lingers, a ghost in the desert air
A reminder of courage, a burden that we share


**Bridge**
We scattered like shrapnel, on the winds of war we flew
Chasing a mission's purpose, some lost, some seeing it through
But the bonds run deep, beneath the surface they reside
Bound by the campfire's glow, where our brothers' spirits abide


**Chorus**
And the hollow turns hallelujah, in the quiet of the years
A symphony of service, washed away by bittersweet tears
We raise our voices, cracked and worn, a campfire choir once more
Singin' hymns of resilience, from the scars that we bore


**Outro**
Hallelujah, hallelujah, from the hollow we rise
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with strength in our eyes
The campfire's memory burns, a beacon in the night
Guiding us home, bathing our souls in its light. 
Hallelujah. 

```

### Notes

## Performance Notes: Hollow Turns Hallelujah

**Vocal Delivery & Style:**

* **Overall:** Aim for a raw, emotive delivery. Think folk/Americana with a touch of gospel influence, particularly in the choruses. The verses should feel intimate and reflective, while the choruses build in power and resonance.
* **Verses:** Start softly, almost conversational. Allow a slight rasp or weariness to color the tone, reflecting the song's themes of loss and reflection.
* **Chorus:** Open up the voice, letting the "hallelujah" soar.  Embrace the "cracked and worn" quality, but ensure it remains controlled and powerful.  Focus on the emotional release.
* **Bridge:**  A blend of the two – initial reflection giving way to growing strength and affirmation as the bridge progresses.
* **Outro:**  Simple, reverent.  Let the final "Hallelujah" resonate and fade slowly, conveying a sense of peace and acceptance.


**Emotional Interpretation:**

* **Core Emotion:** Bittersweet nostalgia.  The song acknowledges the pain and loss of war, but also celebrates the bonds of camaraderie and the enduring spirit of resilience.
* **Verses:**  Focus on the specific images – boot prints, chopper blades, sandbags.  Convey the sense of isolation, longing, and shared experience.
* **Chorus:**  Shift to a feeling of hope and defiance.  The "hollow" transforming into "hallelujah" represents finding meaning and strength in the face of adversity.
* **Bridge:**  Emphasize the duality of scattering and connection.  The bonds forged in war remain, even as individuals take different paths.
* **Outro:**  A sense of closure and healing. The campfire's memory serves as a source of comfort and guidance.


**Key Moments to Emphasize:**

* **"Hollow turns hallelujah":** This is the central paradox of the song. Emphasize the contrast and the transformation.
* **"Bittersweet tears":**  Capture the complex emotions contained within this phrase.
* **"Campfire choir":**  Imagine the scene, the shared warmth and connection.
* **"Scars that we bore":**  Convey the weight of these scars, both physical and emotional.
* **"Beacon in the night":**  Project a sense of hope and guidance.


**Performance Tips for Connecting with the Audience:**

* **Eye contact:**  Connect with individuals in the audience, sharing the story with them.
* **Body language:**  Use subtle gestures and facial expressions to convey the emotions of the song.  A slight slump in the verses, a lifting of the chin in the choruses.
* **Vocal dynamics:**  Vary the volume and intensity to create a dynamic and engaging performance.
* **Storytelling:**  Approach the song as a storyteller, sharing the experiences of these soldiers with the audience.
* **Authenticity:**  The most important element is to connect with the emotional core of the song and deliver it with sincerity and conviction.

## Lantern I Left Behind

### Lyrics

```
Lantern I Left Behind

(Verse 1)
Sunrise spills across the ridge, paints the valley gold
Another day breaks on this farm, a story left untold
Of restless nights and whispered dreams beneath a moonless sky
And the lantern I left burning low, the night you said goodbye.
The crickets chirped a lonely tune, the wind sighed through the trees
I watched your shadow disappear, carried on the breeze.

(Chorus)
Lantern I left behind, a flickering ember glow
A beacon in the darkness, watchin' where you go
A fragile flame against the dawn, a hope I couldn't keep
Just a memory now, a promise I couldn't sleep.

(Verse 2)
The rooster crows, a mournful sound, echoes through the air
Another day to plow these fields, another burden to bear
The coffee's strong and bitter black, like the taste in my mouth now
Remember how we used to laugh, beneath the apple bough?
We carved our initials in the bark, swore it'd always be
But time and distance took their toll, and stole you away from me.

(Bridge)
Maybe someday down the road, our paths will cross again
Maybe someday I'll understand, and forgive the hurt and pain
Maybe someday the lantern's light won't sting my eyes so bright
Maybe someday I'll find my peace, in the stillness of the night.

(Chorus)
Lantern I left behind, a flickering ember glow
A beacon in the darkness, watchin' where you go
A fragile flame against the dawn, a hope I couldn't keep
Just a memory now, a promise I couldn't sleep.

(Outro)
Just a memory now, a lantern I left behind
Burning in the morning light, a love I couldn't find. 
Burning in the morning light…

## Morning After Rain

### Lyrics

```
Morning After Rain

(Verse 1)
Sunrise paints the valley gold, a mist hangs in the air
The creek bed whispers stories of the flood that raged through there
The earth drinks deep, the thirsty roots, reach down for grace anew
And I remember every tear, that washed over me and you


(Chorus)
Morning after rain, the scars begin to bloom
Wildflowers in the canyons, pushing through the gloom
Broken branches reach for light, a testament of will
Morning after rain, His mercy fills me still


(Verse 2)
The wind chimes sing a gentle song, a melody of peace
The broken fence post stands alone, a reminder grief will cease
The scent of honeysuckle sweet, a promise on the breeze
That even in the deepest hurt, there's solace in the trees


(Bridge)
I used to hide the broken parts, afraid to let them show
But every crack and every line, is how I learn to grow
The storm may rage, the thunder roar, but faith will see me through
'Cause even shattered pieces, can reflect the morning dew


(Chorus)
Morning after rain, the scars begin to bloom
Wildflowers in the canyons, pushing through the gloom
Broken branches reach for light, a testament of will
Morning after rain, His mercy fills me still


(Outro)
Morning after rain, the sun breaks through the clouds
Morning after rain, His love shouts out aloud. 
Morning after rain.

## If You’re Breathing, You’re Worth Saving

### Lyrics

```
If You’re Breathing, You’re Worth Saving


**Verse 1**
Dust motes dancing in the faded light
Of a single bulb hanging low tonight
Empty bottle whispers stories untold
Another heart grown weary and old
He sits and stares at the cracked window pane
Rain streaks down like tears, washing away the stain
Of a life lived hard, a path gone astray
Lost in the shadows, afraid of the day


**Chorus**
But if you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
A flicker of hope in the darkness waving
Even when the whispers tell you you’re done
There’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won
If you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
Don’t let the shadows keep you from craving
The light that’s within, the strength you possess
Rise from the ashes, find your blessedness


**Verse 2**
She walks the streets with her head held down
Invisible wounds in this bustling town
A silent scream trapped behind her eyes
Lost in the echoes of a thousand lies
Carries the weight of a broken promise made
A fractured dream that slowly decayed
She searches for solace, a hand to hold tight
A beacon of hope in the darkest of night


**Chorus**
But if you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
A flicker of hope in the darkness waving
Even when the whispers tell you you’re done
There’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won
If you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
Don’t let the shadows keep you from craving
The light that’s within, the strength you possess
Rise from the ashes, find your blessedness


**Bridge**
The world may judge you, may turn away its face
But grace finds its way to the most desolate place
Don’t give up now, there’s still time to mend
A broken heart can learn to love again


**Chorus**
If you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
A flicker of hope in the darkness waving
Even when the whispers tell you you’re done
There’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won
If you’re breathing, you’re worth saving
Don’t let the shadows keep you from craving
The light that’s within, the strength you possess
Rise from the ashes, find your blessedness


**Outro**
If you’re breathing… you’re worth saving…
You’re worth saving…
You’re worth saving…

## Red Dirt Road

### Lyrics

```
Red Dirt Road

(Verse 1)
Sunrise paints the cotton fields a hazy shade of gold
Another town I can't recall, another story told
Of a restless heart and wandering feet, a shadow in the night
Searching for a place to land, a flicker of guiding light
They call me outlaw, rebel soul, a drifter through and through
But beneath this hardened shell, a homesick heart beats true

(Chorus)
Red dirt road, windin' back to where I belong
Where the cypress trees stand tall and the mockingbird's sweet song
Echoes through the valleys, a memory so clear
Red dirt road, whisperin' "you're finally here"

(Verse 2)
Ran from the whispers, the judgment in their eyes
From the expectations heavy, beneath these southern skies
Thought I could outrun the past, the ghosts that held me down
But freedom's just a hollow word in every nameless town
Traded family for the highway, love for open space
Now I see the emptiness etched upon my weary face

(Bridge)
The asphalt ribbon stretched on, a promise never kept
Of something more, something different, a secret I had slept
With for too long, a restless dream that turned into a lie
Now I'm turnin' 'round, headin' back, beneath the open sky

(Chorus)
Red dirt road, windin' back to where I belong
Where the cypress trees stand tall and the mockingbird's sweet song
Echoes through the valleys, a memory so clear
Red dirt road, whisperin' "you're finally here"

(Outro)
Dust devils dancin' in the afternoon sun's glow
Red dirt road, takin' me home, slow and low
Yeah, takin' me home, slow and low. 
Red dirt road, I'm finally home, I know.

## Title: Scars and Smoke

### Lyrics

```
Title: Scars and Smoke

(Verse 1)
Sunrise paints the desert red, another day begun
Dust devils dance across the plains, beneath the weary sun
This ain't the life I planned to live, ain't the hand I chose to play
But the ghosts of yesterday still whisper, and I gotta find my way

(Chorus)
Scars and smoke, a heart of stone, that's what they see in me
A rebel soul, forever roam, a spirit wild and free
But underneath this hardened shell, a fire still burns bright
Fighting through the hurt and hell, to find a little peace tonight

(Verse 2)
The highway stretches out ahead, a ribbon thin and gray
Every mile a memory, of the price I had to pay
For the choices that I made, the bridges I burned down
Searching for redemption's grace, in this forgotten town

(Bridge)
They say time heals all wounds, but mine still bleed and ache
The echoes of the past resound, a promise I couldn't make
But I won't let the darkness win, I won't give up the fight
I'll keep pushing through the din, towards the fading light

(Chorus)
Scars and smoke, a heart of stone, that's what they see in me
A rebel soul, forever roam, a spirit wild and free
But underneath this hardened shell, a fire still burns bright
Fighting through the hurt and hell, to find a little peace tonight

(Outro)
Yeah, just a little peace tonight
Underneath the desert moon, so bright
Just a little peace tonight
Let the weary world be right
Scars and smoke, that's all I know
But I'll keep walking, till I can let it go.

## The Reveal

### Lyrics

```
[Visual Description]
Alex looks straight into the phone camera. His hair is damp, clinging to his forehead. Shirtless, lean muscles carved by hard labour are visible beneath skin kissed by grit and sunlight. There's a weariness around his piercing blue eyes — something raw and unguarded. His voice is low and slow, wrapped in a rich Kentucky drawl that lingers like smoke and honey — rough-edged and intimate, but warm enough to leave you trembling. It’s the kind of voice that brushes over your skin and settles under it, unhurried and unfiltered, drawing you in before you even know why. Deeper than in the songs, it carries weight — every note of it seasoned with longing, pain, and something dangerously tender. His face could stop traffic — sharp jawline cut from mountain stone, cheekbones that catch the low light just right, and those eyes — a piercing, glacial blue that seem to flicker with storm and stillness in the same breath. Tousled dark hair hangs damp against his brow, framing features that belong on a billboard but carry the kind of grief you don’t fake. It’s the kind of face that’s lived too much for its age, and yet it holds something magnetic — something that pulls you in before a word is spoken. He’s heartbreak-handsome, and it’s not just the look — it’s the weight he wears behind it that makes you stare.

Alex (speaking to camera):

“Hey y’all. Been seein’ the comments… the questions. Figured it was time.

My name’s Alex Wilson.”

[He pauses. Lets it sit. Lets it land.]

“Yeah. Alex Wilson. I’m nineteen. Born and raised in Pikeville, Kentucky — coal country. Life don’t care what your birth certificate says out there. You grow up fast when you’ve been workin’ the mines since sixteen just to keep food on the table. First started workin age 9.

Lost my mamma the day I was born. And my old man… well, let’s just say I learned early how to take a hit. Too early.

These days, I’m a few hundred miles from home, sleepin’ in the back of my truck more nights than not. Just drivin’. Tryin’ to figure out what my voice is for.

If you found @blackberrysoul — if you’ve been hearin’ these songs — you’re not just hearin’ melodies. You’re hearin’ my insides turned out. Every scar. Every bruise. Every bit of love I never got to keep.

I wrote 'em right after losin’ the girl I gave everything to. Two jobs — fieldwork in the mornin’, coal dust in my lungs by night — all to put her through school. Thought we were buildin’ somethin’. Turns out, I was the only one holdin' the bricks. But ... she was my best friend as a kid and cleaned me up when Daddy broke me down. So that friendship ain't gonna die.

That pain? That’s 'Love Ain’t Enough'. The fog I fell into? That’s 'The Mourning After'. And that spark tryin’ to rise again? That’s 'Better for the Next Guy'. Running Free was permission to leave.

I ain’t got a deal. Ain’t got a manager. Don’t even know if I want one - still not sure it was right to share so publicly. Still tryin’ to figure out who I am when the music stops.

All I got is this beat-up guitar I found in a dumpster when I was six — hid it under the floorboards from my old man — and a voice that don’t lie no more. Also got a fiddle I found broken outside a bar when I was 9.

This phone? These accounts? They’re my diary now. My truth. Set to chords and thrown into the wind.

I don’t know where this highway ends. Most nights I just pray I can make it to the next tank of gas.”

[He looks down, then back up. Eyes soften. For a split second, the boy behind the voice shines through.]

“But if you’re out there… if you’re listenin’…

Thank you. You’re keepin’ me goin’.”

[He holds the gaze a beat longer, nods once, then taps the phone gently to end the recording.]

## Title:  Wildflower Heart

### Lyrics

```
Title:  Wildflower Heart

(Verse 1)
Grandma's china, chipped and worn
Sitting pretty on a shelf, a life adorned
With stories whispered, dreams untold
A legacy of strength, a heart of gold
But I wasn't born for porcelain and lace
This restless spirit needed open space
To find my own voice, my own design
A different kind of beauty, a wilder vine

(Chorus)
I'm a wildflower heart, blooming late
Reaching for the sun, defying fate
Breaking free from fences, painted white
Dancing in the moonlight, bathed in silver light
I'm a wildflower heart, finally free
This untamed spirit, that's the real me

(Verse 2)
Mama's wisdom, etched in lines
On her hands that worked, through sun and shine
She taught me kindness, grace, and how to pray
But sometimes silence stole my words away
I traded whispers for a roaring sound
My roots ran deeper in unturned ground
Where shadows danced and secrets grew
And I discovered truths, mama never knew

(Bridge)
Maybe it's the wind that carries seeds of change
Across the generations, rearranging
The patterns of our lives, the paths we roam
Until we finally find our way back home
To the heart that beats within, wild and strong
Where we belong, where we've belonged all along

(Chorus)
I'm a wildflower heart, blooming late
Reaching for the sun, defying fate
Breaking free from fences, painted white
Dancing in the moonlight, bathed in silver light
I'm a wildflower heart, finally free
This untamed spirit, that's the real me

(Outro)
Yeah, this wildflower heart, it's finally free
Blooming bright, for everyone to see
This untamed spirit, that's the real me
The real me.

Biography
At nineteen, I wear my scars like armour and my past like a shadow—always close, always shaping who I am. My body's been forged by labour and hardship: broad shoulders that taper into a lean, muscular frame, each sinew a testament to the life I've lived. My sun-bronzed skin bears the imprint of too many harsh summers, while calloused hands tell silent stories of work, pain, and persistence.
My face turns heads—often twice. A sharply chiselled jawline seems etched from stone, paired with striking steel-blue eyes that shift from icy calm to turbulent oceans depending on my mood. My dark, tousled hair falls effortlessly into place, a rare ease in an otherwise relentless existence. Most days, worn denim and plain white tees cling tight to my chest, hiding beneath simplicity the immense weight of unseen burdens. I walk like someone braced for impact, reflexes primed by a childhood spent dodging fists and insults. My rare smiles hold a quiet defiance, as if daring the world to rob me of one more thing.
I grew up hidden away in a battered double-wide trailer, rusting silently at the forgotten end of Blackberry Creek Road near Pikeville, Kentucky—coal country. Our home was a steel cage of broken glass and whispered secrets, resting precariously on cinder blocks amid scrubby pines and mountains that watched in silent judgment. Inside, silence was currency, and I learned early how precious words could be.
Behind those splintered walls, music became my salvation. At six years old, I rescued a cracked and rusted guitar from a roadside dump, smuggling it home beneath my jacket to hide beneath loose floorboards. It became my companion in darkness, strings vibrating with unspoken truths, each note another breath in suffocating silence. When my father passed out, alcohol-soaked and oblivious, I’d coax melodies from beneath battered wood, fingertips raw and bleeding. Music was my only rebellion, my secret strength.
By the time I was nine, I was working. Daddy stayed passed out most mornings, and if I wanted food or a way to get to school, I had to earn it. This was poor country—nobody looked twice. I bussed tables, picked crops, washed trailers, anything I could do to keep the lights on. I've always worked. I raised myself, scraped my knees and stitched my pride. Like the song I wrote later put it:
No lullabies, no 'good job, son' —
Just the sound of doors slammin’ when the hard times come.
That’s not just a lyric. That’s the sound my childhood made.
My musical talent isn't learned—it's lived. Complete songs form vividly in my mind, spilling out fully formed, raw and powerful as storms rolling down the Appalachians. I chase melodies blindly, hands driven by an urgency to release whatever's trapped inside me. It isn't talent as much as it is survival, the lifeline thrown into my solitary ocean of despair. One chorus, more than any other, rides that edge:
Heard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust, A broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.
That line comes from a song I wrote about the day I found my first guitar in a dumpster. I didn't find an instrument — I found a voice.
Yet lyrics still spill onto the page, sometimes without melodies to anchor them. Some lines feel like they've always lived in my blood — I carry them through the day like breath. One verse has haunted me since the first time it came to me, just after a particularly long shift down in the mine:
Coal dust in my lungs, blood on the floor,
Dad’s fists kept time with the slam of the door.
I didn’t write it — I survived it. That line, that rhythm, it just arrived, fully formed. Songs emerge from the shadows of the mountains, echoing the silent ache within me. of the mountains, echoing the silent ache within me. The hardest one, scribbled in the shaky handwriting of a seven-year-old, is titled simply "Mommy, Make Him Stop"—a desperate prayer whispered to the mother I never knew, pleading into emptiness for rescue that never came.
Every instrument I touched became an ally. Invisible piano keys danced under my fingertips on kitchen tables, their silent melodies my first real taste of hope. An abandoned violin, salvaged from a roadside dumpster, sang beneath my touch, its broken strings transforming sorrow into something achingly beautiful. Instruments became weapons—each note a shield, each song a battle won against my past.
My mother's death at childbirth was my father’s endless ammunition. He wielded guilt like a blade, words sharper than his fists, reminding me constantly of the love I'd supposedly stolen. Welts from his belt marked my skin, but deeper wounds silenced my voice, smothering melodies before they could escape. Yet somehow, beneath bruises and scars, my voice endured—deep and resonant, rugged as mountain rock, touched by gravelly tones reminiscent of Chris Stapleton, Johnny Cash's quiet gravity, and the fiery grit of Travis Tritt. But no one has heard it. I’ve never played a gig, never stood before a mic. My songs are mine alone, scribbled into margins and murmured into silence. Each note carries pain, honesty, and defiance.
At sixteen, a fist marked my birthday and eviction notice simultaneously. Cast out with nothing but my instruments and unbroken spirit, I found shelter in another cramped trailer down the road, rented from Mr Jones—barely a home, yet entirely mine. Work was constant: fields, farms, and eventually mines, hands bloodied, knees raw, lungs filled with coal dust. Each dollar earned was another stitch holding my fragmented dreams together.
I built muscle over trauma, seeking strength as armour against vulnerability. Yet, despite relentless hours in fields and mines, the music persisted—trapped, aching, whispering incessantly from within. That battered guitar, once hidden beneath my childhood fears, now travels openly by my side. It remains my shield, my sword, my deepest truth.
Someday soon, I'll summon the courage to let these buried songs free, tearing down the walls I've spent a lifetime constructing. And when that moment comes, the world won’t just hear my music—they'll feel it, raw and powerful, echoing from holler to mountaintop, a voice finally breaking free from silence.

## Whiskey Prayers

### Lyrics

```
Whiskey Prayers

(Verse 1)
The clock on the wall whispers three AM
Another night swallowed by the flickering flame
Of a dying fire, and a burning regret
For words I ain’t spoken, and truths I ain’t met.
This bottle, my confidant, listens so well
To the secrets I keep, the stories I tell
Of a love gone astray, a dream left behind
And the ghost of your laughter that haunts my mind.

(Chorus)
Bottle by bottle, prayer by prayer,
I talk to a God I’m not sure is there.
Forgive me my sins, forgive me my fears —
And hear my whiskey prayers.

(Verse 2)
The ice in my glass clinks a mournful tune
A soundtrack of sorrow beneath the pale moon
I pour out my heart, in this dimly lit room
Hoping for solace, escaping the gloom.
I confess my transgressions, the promises broken
The bridges I burned, the words left unspoken.
I beg for redemption, a chance to rewind
To a time before heartbreak, when love wasn't blind.

(Chorus)
Bottle by bottle, prayer by prayer,
I talk to a God I’m not sure is there.
Forgive me my sins, forgive me my fears —
And hear my whiskey prayers.

(Bridge)
Maybe these whispers, lost in the night
Are just the ramblings of a soul taking flight
Into the darkness, searching for light
A desperate plea in the fading moonlight.
But even if silence is all that I find
A small sliver of hope still lingers behind
That somewhere, somehow, someone understands
These fragile confessions from trembling hands.

(Chorus)
Bottle by bottle, prayer by prayer,
I talk to a God I’m not sure is there.
Forgive me my sins, forgive me my fears —
And hear my whiskey prayers.

(Outro)
Whiskey prayers, rising like smoke
Words unspoken, a heart that’s broke.
Whiskey prayers, lost in the air
A silent confession, nobody there.
Except the bottle, and the lonely chair.
And the ghost of your laughter, everywhere.

## Grace for the Broken

### Lyrics

```
Grace for the Broken


(Verse 1)
Granddaddy's ghost still walks these halls
A shadow cast on these crumbling walls
Anger simmered, a pot left to boil
Passed down the line, poisoning the soil
Mama tried to mend the fractured ground
But the seeds of hurt took root profound
We learned to fight, to bite, to claw
Survival mode became our only law


(Chorus)
For the fists that never learned to fold
For the hearts stitched from pieces of old
There’s a table set and a seat wide open
There’s grace for the broken, yeah, grace for the broken


(Verse 2)
I see it now in my children's eyes
That flicker of fear they try to disguise
The legacy of pain, a heavy chain
Binding us together in this weary refrain
But I'm breaking free, I'm cutting the ties
Trading the shadows for open skies
Learning to forgive, to heal, to grow
Planting seeds of hope where the weeds used to flow


(Bridge)
This ain’t a curse we're destined to bear
This ain't a burden we're forced to share
We can rewrite the story, turn the page
Break the cycle, escape the cage


(Chorus)
For the fists that never learned to fold
For the hearts stitched from pieces of old
There’s a table set and a seat wide open
There’s grace for the broken, yeah, grace for the broken


(Outro)
There's grace enough, there's love enough to mend
The broken branches, make them whole again
Grace for the broken, grace for the broken
A new generation, a new story spoken. 
Grace for the broken.

## After Midnight Promises

### Lyrics

```
After Midnight Promises

(Verse 1)
Tail lights bleedin' into the black
Gravel road hummin' beneath the Cadillac
Radio whispers a forgotten tune
Out here in the dark, bathed in the moon
Got nowhere to be, nowhere to run
Just the echo of your laughter, spun
Into the fabric of this stolen night
Holding on tight, burning ever so bright

(Chorus)
In the hush before the dawn breaks us apart
You trace promises across my heart
No witnesses, just breath and sin
After midnight, we begin again
With tangled limbs and whispered words
Like secrets shared by restless birds
This back road haven, our sacred space
After midnight, we find our grace

(Verse 2)
The scent of honeysuckle hangs heavy and sweet
Mixing with the dust beneath our feet
This old dirt road, a familiar friend
Leading us to where our journeys bend
And intertwine like branches in the breeze
Finding solace in the rustling leaves
The world outside can fade away
In this hidden moment, we choose to stay

(Bridge)
Maybe it’s wrong, this clandestine affair
Stealing moments, breathing borrowed air
But the fire in your eyes, the touch of your hand
Makes this forbidden feeling, grand
I know we’ll part when morning light appears
But these stolen hours will chase away my fears

(Chorus)
In the hush before the dawn breaks us apart
You trace promises across my heart
No witnesses, just breath and sin
After midnight, we begin again
With tangled limbs and whispered words
Like secrets shared by restless birds
This back road haven, our sacred space
After midnight, we find our grace

(Outro)
After midnight, we find our grace
Yeah, after midnight, we find our place
Just you and me, until the break of day
After midnight, we begin again, come what may.

## Title:  Phoenix Flight

### Lyrics

```
Title:  Phoenix Flight

(Verse 1)
Dust devils danced on the cracked, dry land
Reflection stared back, a ghost in my hand
Thought I was buried, six feet beneath the shame
Rattlesnake whisperin',  "Ain't nobody else to blame."
Sun beatin' down, a crucible of pain
But something shifted, a low rumble in the rain.

(Chorus)
These ashes ain't my ending, they're the fuel for the flame
Burnin' off the past, risin' up with a new name
No more lookin' backward, no more chains to hold me down
This ain't a resurrection, this is a phoenix flight outta this town.

(Verse 2)
Built my own pyre with the regrets I'd held tight
Every broken promise, bathed in the fading light
The whispers turned to roars, the demons screamed and cried
As the flames licked higher, I felt the fear subside.
Let the judgment fall, let the gossipers spin their lies
'Cause the only truth that matters is the fire in my eyes.

(Chorus)
These ashes ain't my ending, they're the fuel for the flame
Burnin' off the past, risin' up with a new name
No more lookin' backward, no more chains to hold me down
This ain't a resurrection, this is a phoenix flight outta this town.

(Bridge)
They thought they had me broken, thought I'd wither and fade
But they underestimated the wildfire I had made
From the embers of heartbreak, a fierce spirit takes flight
Soaring through the darkness, bathed in the morning light.

(Chorus)
These ashes ain't my ending, they're the fuel for the flame
Burnin' off the past, risin' up with a new name
No more lookin' backward, no more chains to hold me down
This ain't a resurrection, this is a phoenix flight outta this town.

(Outro)
Yeah, a phoenix flight, a phoenix flight
Outta this town, into the light. 
Flyin' high, leavin' the dust behind
A phoenix flight, peace of mind.

## Title:  Digital Bonfire

### Lyrics

```
Title:  Digital Bonfire

(Verse 1)
Phone screen glowin', midnight blue
Thumb scrollin', lookin' for you
Comments flyin', hearts on fire
Feedin' the flame, takin' it higher
This ain't a game, this ain't pretend
This digital bonfire, it never ends
Pourin' my soul out, line by line
Hopin' your heart catches mine

(Chorus)
Burnin' it up, burnin' it bright
Underneath the digital light
Every word a spark, every song a flame
Playin' with fire, callin' your name
This digital bonfire, reachin' for the sky
Let the embers fly, let the feelings ride high

(Verse 2)
Strumming my guitar, singin' my truth
Spillin' the secrets of my restless youth
Layin' it bare for the world to see
Hopin' you're watchin', hopin' you're with me
This concrete jungle, a lonely place
But in this moment, I find my grace
Connectin' with souls, across the miles
Tradin' our stories, sharin' our smiles

(Bridge)
They say it's fake, they say it's a show
But the heat I feel, down deep I know
It's real as the tears I cry in the night
Real as the dreams that take flight
This digital world, it ain't all bad
It's where I found the love I never had

(Chorus)
Burnin' it up, burnin' it bright
Underneath the digital light
Every word a spark, every song a flame
Playin' with fire, callin' your name
This digital bonfire, reachin' for the sky
Let the embers fly, let the feelings ride high

(Outro)
So log on in, gather 'round the screen
Let the digital bonfire burn bright and keen
Yeah, let it burn.

## Mountain Fire (Raise Up)

### Lyrics

```
Verse 1

In the shadow of the hills where the hard days grind,
Sweat and steel forge a heart that won’t bend or bind.
Pick in hand, boots on stone, through the dust we climb,
Work’s our rhythm, it’s the pulse that keeps us alive.

Pre-Chorus

No storm can break us, no dark can hold,
Strength in our hands, in the fire we mold.

Chorus

Mountain fire, burnin’ fierce, burnin’ proud,
Raise up, shake the earth, let the anthem sound.
From the valleys low to the peaks we climb,
Find your peace in the work, let your spirit shine!

Verse 2

Dawn to dusk, we carve our way through stone,
Every hammer swing’s a vow that we’ll never be owned.
In the toil, in the ache, there’s a truth we find,
Labor’s our freedom, it’s the strength of our kind.

Pre-Chorus

No weight can crush us, no night too long,
We build our peace where the weary grow strong.

Chorus

Mountain fire, burnin’ fierce, burnin’ proud,
Raise up, shake the earth, let the anthem sound.
From the valleys low to the peaks we climb,
Find your peace in the work, let your spirit shine!

Bridge

Feel the ground rumble, hear the workers’ call,
Every strike, every step, we’re unbreaking, we’re tall.
This fire’s our heart, it’s the spark we ignite,
In the sweat of our labor, we’re alive in the fight!

Chorus

Mountain fire, burnin’ fierce, burnin’ proud,
Raise up, shake the earth, let the anthem sound.
From the valleys low to the peaks we climb,
Find your peace in the work, let your spirit shine!

Outro

(Hard stomp, slow picking)
Mountain fire… raise it high… burn forever, touch the sky.
```

### Notes

Sounds Like: Pure Outlaw Country anthem—foot-stomping, stadium-shouting, with a gritty acoustic roar and fiddle stabs that hit like a whiskey shot. Think Chris Stapleton’s raw growl meets Lynyrd Skynyrd’s rebel spirit, built for NFL pre-game hype or gym playlists, driving a crowd to its feet with every pounding chord.

## Scars and Smoke

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**  
Sunrise bleeds red over coal-dust hills, another day’s begun,  
Gravel crunches under boots, chasin’ a merciless sun.  
Ain’t the life I dreamed, boy, ain’t the hand I aimed to draw,  
But ghosts of broken yesterdays still claw me raw.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
No preacher’s words could save me, no bottle drowns the pain,  
Just me and these old scars, walkin’ through the rain.  

**Chorus**  
Scars and smoke, heart carved to stone, that’s all they think I am,  
A rambler’s soul, bound to roam, with a rebel’s give-a-damn.  
But deep beneath this busted shell, a spark still fights to burn,  
Scratchin’ through the gates of hell, for peace I’ll never earn.  

**Verse 2**  
Highway’s a lonesome thread, gray as a miner’s grave,  
Each mile a cut that memory’s blade never forgave.  
Burned my bridges, paid in blood, for choices I can’t mend,  
Huntin’ grace in ghost-town dust, where the lost roads end.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
No mercy in the mirror, just a boy who learned to fight,  
Carvin’ truth from shattered years, under cold starlight.  

**Chorus**  
Scars and smoke, heart carved to stone, that’s all they think I am,  
A rambler’s soul, bound to roam, with a rebel’s give-a-damn.  
But deep beneath this busted shell, a spark still fights to burn,  
Scratchin’ through the gates of hell, for peace I’ll never earn.  

**Bridge**  
They say time stitches wounds, but mine still bleed and scream,  
Echoes of a daddy’s fist haunt every damn dream.  
I won’t let the dark win, won’t lay down and die,  
Gonna claw toward that faint light, till I touch the sky.  

**Chorus**  
Scars and smoke, heart carved to stone, that’s all they think I am,  
A rambler’s soul, bound to roam, with a rebel’s give-a-damn.  
But deep beneath this busted shell, a spark still fights to burn,  
Scratchin’ through the gates of hell, for peace I’ll never earn.  

**Outro**  
*(Slow picking, low E drone)*  
Just a flicker of peace tonight, under this lonesome moon so bright.  
Scars and smoke, it’s all I’ve known,  
Keep walkin’ these roads, till I call ‘em home.
```

### Notes


**Sounds Like**: A gritty, heart-wrenching Outlaw Country ballad in Alex Wilson’s raw, soul-baring style—think Johnny Cash’s somber growl fused with Chris Stapleton’s gravelly ache. Driven by a slow, deliberate acoustic strum and haunting fiddle wails, it’s built for smoky dive bars or quiet nights under a starry sky, evoking pain and resilience with every note.

## Found in the Heartland

### Lyrics

```
Found in the Heartland

(Verse 1)
Heat shimmered on the cracked asphalt road
Cars streamed westward, a heavy load
Of hopes they carried, steel and gasoline
Seeking fortunes, a brighter scene
Than the wheat fields rippling in the breeze
Than the crickets chirping beneath the trees
But I stayed rooted, watched them disappear
'Cause the life they chased never felt so clear

(Chorus)
Found in the heartland, off the beaten track
Slowed my heartbeat, never looked back
While they searched for diamonds, I found the gold
In the simple moments, a story untold
Yeah, found in the heartland, under the sun
Where the river runs deep and the wild horses run
No flashing billboards, no city sky glow
Just the quiet rhythm of a life I know

(Verse 2)
They called me restless, said I lacked direction
Wandering aimlessly, lacking connection
But the city's clamor never stirred my soul
Its crowded streets felt like a losing roll
I found solace in the open sky
In the eagle's sharp cry, way up high
In the river's current, cool and slow
In the simple beauty of the afterglow

(Bridge)
Maybe someday they'll understand
The quiet power of this land
A life built on presence, steady and strong
A quiet victory, where I belong

(Chorus)
Found in the heartland, off the beaten track
Slowed my heartbeat, never looked back
While they searched for diamonds, I found the gold
In the simple moments, a story untold
Yeah, found in the heartland, under the sun
Where the river runs deep and the wild horses run
No flashing billboards, no city sky glow
Just the quiet rhythm of a life I know

(Outro)
Just the quiet rhythm… the quiet rhythm… of a life I know… in the heartland.

## Church of Country

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**  
Pull into Nashville, boots hittin’ holy ground,  
Opry’s singin’ loud, feel that sacred sound.  
From Hank’s raw wail to Dolly’s golden spark,  
Every chord’s a revival, lightin’ up the dark.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Steel and heartstrings, liftin’ voices high,  
A congregation chasin’ truth beneath the sky.  

**Chorus**  
This is the Church of Country, where the legends never fade,  
Cash’s growl, Reba’s fire, every note they played.  
Sing for Stapleton, for Patsy, let the fiddle set you free,  
Opry’s callin’ all our hearts, it’s where we’re meant to be!  

**Verse 2**  
Loretta’s mountain truth, Willie’s wanderin’ soul,  
George Jones’ whiskey cry, keepin’ us whole.  
Miranda’s spark of fight, Luke’s hometown cheer,  
Saints and rebels gather ‘round, the spirit’s livin’ here.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
From Waylon’s outlaw strut to Tammy’s velvet plea,  
Every song’s a gospel, every seat’s family.  

**Chorus**  
This is the Church of Country, where the legends never fade,  
Cash’s growl, Reba’s fire, every note they played.  
Sing for Stapleton, for Patsy, let the fiddle set you free,  
Opry’s callin’ all our hearts, it’s where we’re meant to be!  

**Bridge**  
It’s a honky-tonk redemption, where the broken find their place,  
Randy Travis’ gentle hymn, Kacey’s fearless grace.  
From the Ryman’s wooden pews to the circle’s golden glow,  
Country’s heart beats loud and true, forever we’ll go!  

**Chorus**  
This is the Church of Country, where the legends never fade,  
Cash’s growl, Reba’s fire, every note they played.  
Sing for Stapleton, for Patsy, let the fiddle set you free,  
Opry’s callin’ all our hearts, it’s where we’re meant to be!  

**Outro**  
*(Fiddle kicks, steel guitar swells)*  
Church of Country, raise your voice, let it soar,  
Opry’s home, our heaven’s door, forevermore!
```

### Notes

***

**Sounds Like**: A vibrant ‘90s-meets-modern country anthem with the infectious, polished energy of Dan + Shay’s crowd-pleasers, but rooted in Alex Wilson’s raw, Opry-worshipping reverence. Think soaring steel guitar, upbeat fiddle runs, and a sing-along chorus that lights up arenas or honky-tonks, celebrating country music’s divine legacy with a fresh, celebratory twang.

## Tales from the Heartland

### Lyrics

```

Verse 1
In the heartland’s dust, where the sun don’t quit,
Calloused hands carve dreams from the gravel and grit.
Miners swing picks ‘neath the Kentucky clay,
Farmers sow hope through the long, hard day.

Pre-Chorus
Sweat on their brows, fire in their soul,
Buildin’ a life where the heartland rolls.

Chorus
Tales from the heartland, sing ‘em loud, sing ‘em proud,
Workers risin’ up, shakin’ earth with the sound!
From the coal-dark depths to the fields of green,
These are the stories of the folks we’ve seen!

Verse 2
Factory lines hum where the midnight oil burns,
Truckers haul heavy while the big wheels turn.
Waitresses smile through the ache in their feet,
Every small-town heart keeps the rhythm sweet.

Pre-Chorus
Blood in their veins, fight in their core,
Carvin’ out futures where the heartland soars.

Chorus
Tales from the heartland, sing ‘em loud, sing ‘em proud,
Workers risin’ up, shakin’ earth with the sound!
From the coal-dark depths to the fields of green,
These are the stories of the folks we’ve seen!

Bridge
Raise a glass to the hands that build, to the hearts that bleed,
To the mamas and daddies plantin’ every seed.
In the hollers and plains, their voices unite,
Singin’ tales of the heartland, burnin’ bright tonight!

Chorus
Tales from the heartland, sing ‘em loud, sing ‘em proud,
Workers risin’ up, shakin’ earth with the sound!
From the coal-dark depths to the fields of green,
These are the stories of the folks we’ve seen!

Outro
(Fiddle flourish, hard stomps)
Tales from the heartland, let ‘em ring, let ‘em fly,
Workin’ folks forever, holdin’ up the sky!
```

### Notes

Sounds Like: A rousing, upbeat gospel-country anthem with the soul-stirring energy of a Zac Brown Band barn-burner crossed with the communal fire of The Oak Ridge Boys. Driven by pounding acoustic guitar, soaring steel guitar, and jubilant fiddle runs, it’s a foot-stomping celebration of heartland workers—miners, farmers, factory hands—crafted for festival stages or small-town revivals, lifting every voice in the crowd.

## Mountain’s Dawn

### Lyrics

```
**Verse 1**  
The mountain stayed, but I had to run,  
Coal dust trails chasin’ dreams in the sun.  
Her smile lit the holler, showed me I could soar,  
Gave me wings to fly through a slammed-shut door.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
No chain could bind me, no scar could dim,  
Her spark’s the fire that’s blazin’ within.  

**Chorus**  
The mountain’s dawn is callin’, and I’m risin’ to its glow,  
Holdin’ tight to hope she helped my heart to know.  
Every song’s a promise, every mile a brand-new start,  
Singin’ for the light she gave, it’s healin’ up my heart.  

**Verse 2**  
Pikeville’s shadows fade in the rearview’s haze,  
Highway hums a hymn of brighter days.  
From a rusted guitar to a stage that shines,  
I’m weavin’ her belief into these songs of mine.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
No night’s too heavy, no road too long,  
Her faith’s the fuel that keeps me strong.  

**Chorus**  
The mountain’s dawn is callin’, and I’m risin’ to its glow,  
Holdin’ tight to hope she helped my heart to know.  
Every song’s a promise, every mile a brand-new start,  
Singin’ for the light she gave, it’s healin’ up my heart.  

**Bridge**  
She bandaged my soul when the world cut deep,  
Planted dreams in a boy too bruised to sleep.  
Now I’m runnin’ toward the sunrise, with a voice that won’t stay still,  
Carryin’ her hope to every heart, from holler to the hill.  

**Chorus**  
The mountain’s dawn is callin’, and I’m risin’ to its glow,  
Holdin’ tight to hope she helped my heart to know.  
Every song’s a promise, every mile a brand-new start,  
Singin’ for the light she gave, it’s healin’ up my heart.  

**Outro**  
*(Bright fiddle lift, steady picking)*  
Mountain’s dawn keeps shinin’, and I’m never lookin’ back,  
Her hope’s my guiding star, lightin’ up the track.
```

### Notes


**Sounds Like**: A soaring, hope-filled Alex Wilson anthem, blending the raw ache of his Appalachian roots with an uplifting gospel-country shine. Picture Tyler Childers’ heartfelt grit meeting Chris Stapleton’s soulful lift, driven by bright acoustic strums, a buoyant fiddle, and a steel guitar that glimmers like sunrise. Crafted for a festival stage or a tailgate under a clear sky, it’s a beacon of resilience and renewal.

## Lightning in a Bottle

### Lyrics

```
Lightning in a Bottle

(Verse 1)
Barefoot on the porch swing, fireflies in the pines
Mama's sweet tea brewing, daddy humming honky-tonk lines
Didn't know it then, but time was standing still
Just a whisper of forever, on that Georgia hill

(Verse 2)
Sneakin' out to the river, first taste of cheap wine
Radio hummin' low, beneath the moonlight shine
Your hand in mine, a spark ignites the flame
Didn't know it then, but nothin' would be the same

(Chorus)
First kiss, first laugh, first wrong turn made
Every scar and lesson learned, a price gladly paid
Heaven spilled over, in a Mason jar full throttle
We caught lightning in a bottle

(Verse 3)
Years flew by like tumbleweeds across a dusty plain
Through sunshine and through heartache, the love remained
Built a life together, brick by weathered brick
Every crack and imperfection, a love that will not stick

(Verse 4)
Now the grandkids are runnin' wild, just like we used to do
Fireflies still dancin', sky a brilliant blue
Holding your hand tighter, wrinkles around my eyes
This ain't the end of forever, it's just a new sunrise

(Bridge)
They say time keeps on tickin', and seasons come and go
But the memories we've made, they'll forever glow
Like embers in the darkness, a warm and steady light
Guiding us through the shadows, holding us through the night

(Chorus)
First kiss, first laugh, first wrong turn made
Every scar and lesson learned, a price gladly paid
Heaven spilled over, in a Mason jar full throttle
We caught lightning in a bottle

(Outro)
Yeah, we caught lightning in a bottle
And we'll hold on tight, forever.
Lightning in a bottle.
Our forever.
