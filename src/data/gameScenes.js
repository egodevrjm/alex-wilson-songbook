His guitar case remains stubbornly unopened across his knees, his shoulders tense. Nearby, a teenager with a sequined vest frantically searches for a spare speaker for their talent show performance, their hopeful energy tinged with panic. A few stragglers meander through the lot, some glancing at Alex, others distracted by their melting ice cream cones. The sun beats down, reflecting off the drone's casing in sharp glints.`,
