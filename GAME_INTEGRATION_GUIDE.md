## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Game Mode not showing:**
- Make sure you've run the migration

- Refresh the page

**Attributes not saving:**

- Try clearing cache and reloading

**Social media not showing reactions:**

## üìù Game Mode Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with low attributes and build up
2. **Track everything**: Use performance history for narrative
3. **Engage with reactions**: Social media provides story hooks
4. **Build connections**: They're key to career progression
5. **Balance meters**: Don't let Hope get too low or Rage too high
6. **Use time wisely**: Advance time strategically
7. **Release strategically**: Not every song needs immediate release
